# Agentic AI Compliance Webapp – Brainstorming Session Results

## 🎯 Problem Overview

Design an agentic AI webapp for board members that:
- Transcribes multilingual meetings (Arabic + English, code-switching supported)
- Detects ESG/Compliance violations in real time
- References regulations stored as documents in Pinecone vector DB
- Alerts with speaker and timestamp metadata
- Classifies uploaded regulation documents
- Uses mostly open-source tech, with Gemini API for LLMs

## ⚙️ Mission Slices (Agent Units)

| Slice Name              | Responsibility                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multilingual STT Agent** | Real-time Arabic/English transcription with code-switching and speaker ID      |
| **Diarization Agent**     | Detects and tracks speakers dynamically during live speech                      |
| **Compliance Watchdog**  | Cross-checks transcript against Pinecone rules and detects violations            |
| **Document Classifier**  | Categorizes regulatory documents for smarter query and matching                  |
| **Alert Generator**      | Triggers real-time alerts with context (speaker, time, content)                 |
| **UX Mediator**          | Ensures minimal, high-signal UI alerts suitable for boardroom usage            |

## 🔗 Value Chain Expansion

| Phase             | Value Opportunity                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Before Meeting** | Document upload + auto-categorization (reduce prep load)                         |
| **During Meeting** | Live cross-language transcription + alert system for policy violations           |
| **After Meeting**  | Downloadable violation reports, searchable transcripts, speaker summaries        |

## ⚠️ Failure First – Risk Table

| Risk/Failure | Implication | Preventive/Responsive Design |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| STT errors (esp. dialects) | False alerts / missed violations | Open-source ASR fine-tuned for Arabic; fallback to Gemini |
| Speaker switching mid-sentence | Diarization fails | Use word-level diarization, detect language shifts dynamically |
| False positives in detection | Distrust or ignored system | Combine semantic relevance + rule matching with thresholds |
| Alert overload | User frustration | Severity filter, tiered alerts |
| Document misclassification | Missed rule coverage | Classifier training on labeled ESG corpora + optional manual validation |
