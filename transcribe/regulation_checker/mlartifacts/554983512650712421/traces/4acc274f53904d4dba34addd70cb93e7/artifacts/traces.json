The incident involves sharing user data with unauthorized individuals, including family members.\\n\\n1.  Specific Compliance Violations:\\n\\n    *   GDPR Article 5(1)(f): Violation of the principle of integrity and confidentiality by processing personal data in a manner that does not ensure appropriate security against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.\\n    *   GDPR Article 6: Violation of lawfulness of processing, as there is no apparent lawful basis (consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, legitimate interests) for sharing the data with unauthorized individuals.\\n    *   GDPR Article 29: Processing under the authority of the controller or processor must adhere to GDPR guidelines, which is compromised by unauthorized sharing.\\n2.  Regulatory Framework:\\n\\n    *   GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): The primary regulatory framework violated. The unauthorized sharing of user data directly contravenes the GDPR's core tenets regarding data protection and privacy.\\n3.  Policy Breaches:\\n\\n    *   Information Security and Data Handling Policy: The specific policy violated is the \\\"Information Security and Data Handling\\\" policy. This policy likely outlines the procedures and safeguards required to protect sensitive user data from unauthorized access and disclosure.\\n4.  Risk Severity:\\n\\n    *   HIGH: The risk severity is categorized as HIGH due to the potential for significant harm to data subjects, substantial fines under GDPR (up to 4% of annual global turnover), reputational damage, and legal consequences.\\n5.  Urgency Level:\\n\\n    *   Critical: Immediate action is required to contain the breach, assess the extent of the data sharing, and notify relevant parties (data protection authority and affected data subjects, if required).\\n6.
