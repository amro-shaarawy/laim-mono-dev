The sample used in the \\\\nstudy i s based on the 50 most active Egyptian companies listed in the Egyptian stock \\\\nmarket; these companies are considered the best reflection for the Egyptian market. The \\\\nfindings from this research provide evidence that there is a positive relationship between  the \\\\nproportion of independent directors on the board and firm financial performance as \\\\nmeasured by ROE, board meetings results showed a positive significant relationship with \\\\nROE, CEO duality showed a significant positive relationship with ROE, and the director \\\\nownership is positively associated with firm performance as measured by ROE, but the \\\\nrelation is not significant.

Introduction  \\\\n \\\\nIn the past decades very little attention was grabbed towards corporate governance and boards of \\\\ndirectors; they were only handled by some management teaching, researc h and popular writing. The \\\\nterm Corporate Governance was not even used until well in to the 1980s. However, beginning in the \\\\n1980s and continuing and growing within the 1990s, corporate governance received increasing attention \\\\namong practitioners, academic s and other groups.  \\\\n* \\\\nEarly at this century, some major corporate meltdowns received extensive media attention; like Enron, \\\\nWorldCom and Adelphia began to receive more attention than before. Yet, corporate governance was \\\\nbeing noticed even before those me ltdowns. Further, the major corporate scandals that happened \\\\nraised much corporate issues such as the role of† board of directors in monitoring management \\\\nperformance.  \\\\n  \\\\n                                                           \\\\n**Mr. Mrwan Amer, Lecturer  in Accounting and Finance, College of Management & Tech., Arab Academy for Sciences & \\\\nTech., Egypt, PhD student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, Email:  mrwan.amer@gmail.com      \\\\n**Prof. Dr. Ai man Ahmed Ragab, Dean of College of Management & Tech., Arab Academy for Sciences & Tech., Egypt, E \\\\nmail: aaragab@aast.edu     \\\\n***Dr. Mohamed A .

They can aid  in linking the \\\\nfirm to its environment, provide secure critical resources (Williamson, 1996; Hillman et al., 2000), and \\\\ncontribute actively in a firm‟s strategic  decision making (Fama  & Jensen, 1983, Davies, 1999; Kemp, \\\\n2006). Another important role of bo ards is to act as a mechanism of internal governance and monitoring \\\\nof management (Barnhart, Marr & Rosenstein, 1994; Shleifer  & Vishny, 1997). A board performing \\\\nthese roles effectively is likely to facilitate superior firm performance (Hawkins, 1997; Gom pers, Ishii, &  \\\\nMetrick, 2003). The critical role a board plays in the success of a firm merits an in -depth research on \\\\ndifferent factors that link a board to a firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n2. Description of the Existing Egyptian Governance  \\\\n \\\\nBoards in the Egyptian comp anies seemed to be a one -tier structure; meaning that one single board \\\\ncomprising executive and non -executive directors. Such type of board structure is predominant in \\\\ncountries such as the UK, the USA and the majority of EU Member States (Mallin, 2007). H owever, in \\\\nEgypt, boards lack the rules that govern their structure from executive or non -executive directors. The \\\\nconcept of „non -executive director‟ was firstly introduced in the 2002 listing rules.  As stated in the \\\\nEgyptian code of corporate governance  “The BOD should include a majority of non -executive members \\\\nwith an appropriate mix of skills, technical, or analytical experience that is of benefit to the board or \\\\ncorporation.”  \\\\n \\\\nEgyptian companies often practice CEO duality; where only one person plays both roles: the chairman \\\\nand the CEO. The board member responsible for the executive management is sometimes called the \\\\nmanaging director or the chief executive officer. This means that the CEO is responsible for the running \\\\nof the board as well as the run ning of the company‟s business. As stated in the Egyptian code of \\\\ncorporate governance  “The BOD undertakes the designation of the chairperson and managing director; \\\\nit is preferred that the two posts not be held by the same person.\\\"  \\\\n \\\\nAs for the board size,  the board of directors is usually composed of an odd number of members, at least \\\\nthree.  The annual general assembly is responsible for electing directors on the board for a period of \\\\nthree renewable years, setting their remuneration, and removing them if necessary. Directors must \\\\nsubmit their resume, including a list of companies with which they have been related during the previous \\\\nthree years. For an employee to be recruited as a director, he/she must have been serving the company \\\\nfor at least two years.  In case the company experiences losses, board members cannot be re -\\\\nappointed.  \\\\n \\\\nBoard meetings are held upon the request of either the chairman or two -thirds of the members. A board \\\\nmeeting is considered valid only if the number of attendees is not less th an half of its members plus one, \\\\nwhere the number of attendees must be at least three. Despite this, there is no disclosure of board \\\\nmeeting attendance. The board is fully responsible to the shareholders. In this essence, the board of \\\\ndirectors‟ main respo nsibility falls in supervising the implementation of the company‟s objectives as \\\\ndecided by its general assembly. In light of such responsibility, the board of directors perform many \\\\nfunctions; including inviting the shareholders to meet, investing the com pany‟s funds, requesting loans, \\\\nappointing executive managers and submitting financial statements and board reports to the general \\\\nassembly meeting.  \\\\n--- Page 3 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n2 \\\\n As stated in the Egyptian code of corporate governance  “The board should convene no less than once \\\\nevery t hree months. The number of conventions and the names of the members who failed to attend the \\\\nmeetings of the board or its sub -committees will be revealed in the corporation‟s annual report.”  \\\\n \\\\n3. Literature review and hypothes es development  \\\\n \\\\nBasically the boar d should be the main mechanism of internal governance and monitoring of \\\\nmanagement (Barnhart et al. 1994; Shleifer and Vishny 1997). An effective and strong board could aid \\\\nfirm performance economically. As it can link a firm to its environment, secure cri tical resources \\\\n(Williamson 1996; Hillman et al. 2000), and significantly affects the firm‟s strategic decision making \\\\n(Fama and Jensen 1983; Davies 1999 and Kemp 2006). Hence, such a board would likely help the firm \\\\nto improve performance (Hawkins 1997; G ompers et al. 2003).       \\\\n \\\\n3.1 Board Independence  \\\\n \\\\nUp till the 1960s boards in the United States were mostly composed of internal directors. But since then \\\\nand up to the current situation, firms have had more predictable wisdom that turned board compositi on \\\\nto be mostly composed of external directors. (Bhagat  & Black, 2002).  Hermalin and Weisbach (1988) \\\\nand Bhagat and Black (2002) found that firms experiencing poor performance were more likely to \\\\nincrease the proportion of outside directors than better per forming firms, signifying a contraction of \\\\nmonitoring in order to lessen agency problems. However, neither author found that improved \\\\nperformance stemmed from these changes. Hill and Snell (1988) found that the proportion of outside \\\\ndirectors on the board and profitability were positively associated. Similarly, Brown and Caylor (2004) \\\\nfound that a board whose the majority of its members are independent directors helps the firm to \\\\nachieve higher returns on equity, higher profit margins, larger dividend yield s, and larger stock \\\\nrepurchases. Nonetheless, Hermalin and Weisbach (1991) concluded from their study that there isn‟t \\\\nany significant impact of the insider/outsider ratio of boards on Tobin‟s Q. Accordingly;  they argued that \\\\ninsiders and outsiders were mo re-or-less equivalent in affecting firm performance. Also, Agrawal and \\\\nKnoeber (1996) found that the existence of more outsiders on the board was linked to higher levels of \\\\ndebt financing and lower levels of firm performance.  John and Senbet (1998) argued that a board \\\\nhaving more non -executive directors (NEDs) is considered to be more independent. Yet, relating this to \\\\nfirm performance yielded mixed or inconsistent results in different empirical studies. In one breath, it is \\\\nasserted that executive (inside)  directors are more familiar with a firm‟s activities and thus are more \\\\ncapable of monitoring top management. On the other hand, it is contended that NEDs are treated as \\\\n“professional referees” to ensure that competition among insiders stimulates actions c onsistent with \\\\nshareholder value maximization (Fama, 1980). Weisbach (1988) and Cotter et al. (1997) supported this \\\\nview emphasizing that outside directors play a critical role in protecting shareholders‟ interest through \\\\neffective decision control. Still,  some authors didn‟t identify any significant relationship between \\\\nproportion of NEDs and firm performance (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1991; Bhagat and Black, 2002). It \\\\nhas been rather shown that the effectiveness of a board depends on the optimal mix of insid e and \\\\noutside directors (Fama and Jensen, 1983; Baysinger and Butler, 1985; Baysinger and Hoskinsson, \\\\n1990; Baums, 1994). However, available theory is inadequate on the determinants of optimal board \\\\ncomposition (Weisbach, 2002). We measure the independence  of the board by finding the ratio of NEDs \\\\nto board size and we expect this to have a positive relationship with firm performance. Subsequently we \\\\ntest the following hypothesis:  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 4 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n3 \\\\n H1: Greater independence of the board of directors is associated with higher  firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n3.2 Board Size  \\\\n \\\\nIt has been a debate, from many perspectives, whether the board is preferred to be of a large size or \\\\nsmall size (Jensen 1993; Yermack, 1996; Dalton et al., 1999; Hemalin  &Weisbach, 2003). While some \\\\nfavored smaller boar ds to improve firm performance (e.g., Lipton &Lorsch, 1992; Jensen 1993; \\\\nYermack, 1996) others have recommended that larger boards are better for enhancing firm performance \\\\n(Pfeffer, 1972; Klein, 1998; Adam &  Mehran, 2003; Anderson et al., 2004; Coles et a l., 2008). For \\\\nexample; Lipton &Lorsch, 1992 went for smaller boards claiming that they would help the firm to avoid \\\\nsocial loafing and free -riding. Jensen, 1993 added that smaller boards usually ease co -ordination, \\\\ncohesiveness and communication. This mat ches O‟Reilly et al., 1989 view which declared that with the \\\\nincrease in board size, the effectiveness of interpersonal communication decreases, and coordination \\\\nproblems seem to be obvious, which would most probably develop factions and conflicts. Also, e arlier \\\\nstudies; Yermack (1996) and Eisenberg et al. (1998) have practically proven that smaller boards are \\\\nlinked to higher firm value.  \\\\n \\\\nOn the other hand, larger boards were seen beneficial on the ground that they enable advice to CEO \\\\nand superior monitor ing of management (Pfeffer, 1972; Klein, 1998; Adam &  Mehran, 2003; Anderson \\\\net al., 2004; Coles et al., 2008). Klein (1998) argued that the more the organization becomes complex, \\\\nthe more the CEO will need advice. Klein further added that advisory needs o f CEO also increase as \\\\nlong as the firm‟s dependence on environmental resources increases. In this essence, increasing board \\\\nsize helps businesses to manage the environment (Pfeffer, 1972; Pearce & Zahra, 1992). Furthermore, \\\\nthe agency theory supports larg er boards for their monitoring effectiveness that is developed by limiting \\\\nthe domination of the CEO within the board and protecting shareholders interests (Singh &  Harianto, \\\\n1989).  \\\\n \\\\nHermalin and Weishbach (1998) argued that board independence; which mainl y depends on the \\\\nnegotiations between the board and the CEO, promotes board effectiveness. Accordingly, in larger \\\\nboards, the bargaining position of the board becomes stronger against the CEO and thus, enabling the \\\\nboard to monitor management more effectiv ely. Further, a larger board will also ease the creation of \\\\ncommittees to delegate specialized responsibilities.  From the resource dependency theory perspective, \\\\nboards are chosen to maximize the provision of important resources to the firm (Pfeffer, 1972;  Pfeffer  & \\\\nSalancik, 1978; Klein, 1998; Hillman &  Dalziel, 2003). Recalling the demonstration shown previously by \\\\nKlein (1998) concerning the advisory needs of the CEO in case of increased dependence on \\\\nenvironmental resources, increasing board size links the organization to its external environment and \\\\nsecures critical resources. In response to resource dependencies and regulatory pressures, \\\\norganizations create large boards to encompass directors from different backgrounds (Pfeffer, 1972; \\\\nPearce & Zahra, 1992).  \\\\n \\\\nFinally, to sum up, while the smaller boards provide a greater room for CEO domination of board \\\\nresulting in agency costs, larger boards benefit firms by providing effective oversight of management, \\\\nenabling the firm to opt the available necessary resources and allowing for representation of different \\\\nstakeholders in the firm. This makes larger boards more beneficial in improving firm performance. \\\\nConsequently, this research proposes the following hypothesis:  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n4 \\\\n H2: There is positive relationship betw een board size and firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n3.3. CEO Duality  \\\\n \\\\nLeighton and Thain (1993), and Lechem, (2002) highlighted that the board Chair plays a significant role \\\\nin the decision making as well as the effectiveness in monitoring the management while the later  being \\\\nheaded by the Chief executive. However, in many cases, these two positions are merged making only \\\\none person in charge to build a unified leadership. Actually, stewardship theorists supported this view \\\\nreferring to it as CEO duality, arguing that it  enhances the effectiveness of leadership in organizations \\\\n(Finkelstein &  D‟Aveni, 1994). On the other hand, agency theorists went for the separation of the two \\\\npositions to ensure the effective monitoring of management.  Determining which of separation or CEO \\\\nduality would be better for a firm is being investigated by different studies producing mixed results. For \\\\nexample, Lipton and Lorsch (1993), Worrell, Nemec and Davidson (1997), and Carlsson (2001) \\\\nopposed CEO duality claiming that it compromises the m onitoring role of the board due to conflict of \\\\ninterest. They asserted that in case of a strong CEO, CEO duality would make the board insufficient and \\\\npowerless. Lorsch and MacIver (1989) have raised the question of whether directors are pawns or \\\\npotentate s in front of the CEO. Moreover, Rechner and Dalton (1991) concluded that firms where CEOs \\\\nhave a dual role usually have less performance than those without CEO duality.  \\\\n \\\\nIn contrast, other studies like Anderson & Anthony, 1986; Donaldson & Davis, 1991, an d Charan, 1998 \\\\nsupported CEO duality. They argued that separating the chairman and CEO positions would prevent the \\\\nfirm from having the unified focus of its energies which are vital in realizing the organizational goals. \\\\nThey declared that a CEO serving th e chairman position as well will have full authority over the firm that \\\\nwould aid improving firm performance. Boyd (1995) found that duality actually led to better performance \\\\namong the US firms. Nevertheless, another set of scholars (Daily & Dalton, 1997;  Dalton et al., 1998; \\\\nWeir & Laing, 1999,  Abdullah, 2004) have not detected any effective difference between the firms with \\\\nCEO duality and those without.  In a recent meta -analysis, Rhoades et al. (2001) provided support for \\\\nthe emergencies view that the f ramework of the study moderates the relationship between CEO duality \\\\nand firm performance. For instance, CEO duality and firm performance are positively related in the anti -\\\\ntakeover studies and negatively related in the compensation studies. Focusing on th e importance of \\\\ncontext on the study of CEO duality, Rhoades et al. (2001) stated “our findings highlight the value of \\\\nstudying the situations when  two heads are better than one, rather than exploring whether two heads \\\\nare better than one . Obviously furthe r research is required to increase our understanding on this \\\\nmatter”.  In US firms, CEO duality is as high as 80 – 84 per cent (Lorsch& MacIver, 1989; Core et al., \\\\n1999; Vafeas, 1999). According to Rechner, 1989, when al l the power is conc entrated in the ha nds of \\\\nCEO, the board turns to be „a rubber‟.  The CEO duality most probably would raise agency problems, \\\\nlimiting the effectiveness of board in management monitoring (Jensen, 1993; Strickland, Wiles &Zenner, \\\\n1996). It is also considered an obstacle to boar d‟s flexibility in performing one of its main duties of \\\\nreplacing a poorly performing CEO (Goyal  & Park, 2002) and is allied with too much compensation \\\\n(Core et al., 1999).  \\\\nBy the way, Hence, CEO duality is likely to unfavorably affect firm performance. Gi ven that, this \\\\nresearch proposes the following hypothesis:  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n5 \\\\n H3: CEO duality is negatively associated with firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n3.4 Board Meetings  \\\\n \\\\nConger et al. (1998) has referred to board meetings as a critical resource for improving the board \\\\neffective ness. Likely, Vafeas, 1999 viewed the strength of board activity as a significant value -relevant \\\\nboard attribute. Actually, the frequency by which board members meet; to discuss the different issues \\\\nraised against the firm, strongly influences the effectiv eness of the board. (Vafeas, 1999; Carcello, et al., \\\\n2002). Conscientious boards are able to improve the level of supervision, resulting in better firm \\\\nperformance. For a board to be diligent, however, board meeting is not the only important aspect; other \\\\naspects are rather important; such as preparation before meetings, attentiveness, and participation \\\\nduring meetings and post -meeting follow -up \\\\n(Carcello et al., 2002). Though, board meeting is the only noticeable and publicly documented aspect.  A \\\\npriori , the nature of the relationship between board activity intensity and firm performance is not clear. \\\\nYet, many studies  asserted that board meetings are beneficial to shareholders, and  emphasized the \\\\nimportance frequency of these board meetings. For instance, Zahra and Pearce (1989) speculated that \\\\neffective meetings are crucial for successful board performance. Similarly, Vafeas (1999) argued that \\\\nincreased board meetings map the intensity of board activity and concluded a significant relationship \\\\nbetween boar d meetings and firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\nLipton &  Lorsch, 1992 and Byrne, 1996 recommended that the more frequent a board meets, the higher \\\\nthe likelihood of performing its duties diligently to protect shareholders interests. In this study it was \\\\nstated that  “the most widely shared problem directors face is lack of time to carry out their duties”. Also, \\\\nBeasley et al. (2000) observed that fraud records increase at firms that have less number of audit \\\\ncommittee meetings. And, Lawler et al. (2002) found that board practices are positively related to firm  \\\\nperformance. On the contract, Uzun  et al.  (2004) did not detect any significant  difference in board \\\\nmeetings, whether or not the firm is involved in fraud records.  Also, from the agency perspective, the \\\\nboard is pri marily responsible for monitoring management to be able to diminish agency costs and \\\\nappropriation by the managers. And, the Effectiveness of boards can be enhanced by meeting \\\\nrecurrently (Latendre, 2004) and signifying greater diligence (Carcello, et al.,  2002). On the other side, \\\\nVafeas  (1999) recommended that for monitoring an agency to maintain good governance, increasing \\\\nfrequency of board meetings would be easier than changing any of the other board characteristics, like, \\\\ndirector ownership or gender diversity. Lawler et al. (2002) demonstrated the positive relationship \\\\nbetween effective board practices and firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\nAs concluded empirically, board meetings are considered a resource that would lead to board diligence. \\\\nAlso, increased board mee tings is beneficial for the board as it provides more time for directors to \\\\ndiscuss, set strategy, and monitor management effectively. Increasing meetings frequency is relatively \\\\nless expensive than changing other board characteristics to not only protect shareholder value but also \\\\nto improve firm performance. In regard of this conclusion, the following hypothesis has been developed:  \\\\n \\\\nH4: Board meetings are positively associated with firm performance  \\\\n \\\\n3.5 Director Ownership  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n6 \\\\n Berle and Means (1932) outpointe d a relationship between ownership and firm performance, \\\\nrecommending that firms going public should separate ownership from control. Fama  & Jensen, 1983 \\\\nsupported this view stating that ownership separation improves professionalism through management \\\\nproficiency and firm -specific knowledge.  This view is however opposed by the agency theory which \\\\nreveals that separating ownership from control generates conflict of interests (Berle  & Means, 1932), \\\\nwhich in turn leads to expropriation by managers (Fama, 1980;  Shleifer  &Vishny, 1997). While \\\\nstockholders are concerned with maximizing the value of the firms, managers might be only considering \\\\nhow to develop their personal wealth and prestige. These diverse interests between shareholders and \\\\nmanagers incur agency costs that require the provision of monitoring mechanisms by the boards of \\\\ndirectors (Fama  & Jensen, 1983). The agency theory suggested that aligning the interests of the \\\\nmanagers more closely with those of shareholders/owners; by increasing managers‟ stoc k ownership, \\\\nwould help minimize the potential conflict (Jensen &  Meckling, 1976). Joining the ownership and control \\\\nthrough meaningful director stock ownership would probably lead to better management monitoring \\\\n(Elson, 1996). Such alignment of interests would lessen the need for monitoring and mitigating agency \\\\ncosts.  \\\\n \\\\nOn the other hand, McGregor (1967) argued that that conflict might be eliminated if an individual \\\\nidentifies with an organization and then intentionally directs his efforts towards the orga nizational goals. \\\\nDavis et al. (1997) supported this view pointing out that there isn‟t inherited conflict between managers \\\\nand shareholders. The author rather posited a fact, that managers at professional levels are highly \\\\ncommitted to the organization an d its goals, whereas shareholders might only be concerned with short \\\\nterm returns. Moreover, Fama (1980) and Shleifer and Vishny (1997) declared that there is a positive \\\\nlink between reputation and compensation of directors. The importance of reputation fo r directors lies in \\\\nhelping them in career growth and compensation. As stated by (Elson, 1996), in many cases, effective \\\\nperformance of directors is further compensated or rewarded by means of granting stocks.  \\\\n \\\\nEmpirically, many studies indicate that manag erial ownership improves firm performance (e.g., Jensen \\\\n& Murphy, 1990; Chung & Pruitt, 1996; Palia  & Lichtenberg, 1999). Brickley et al. (1988) argued that \\\\nmanagers and board members owning stocks are more motivated and keen to run the firm efficiently \\\\nand to control managers carefully. However, other studies were not so obvious about the relationship \\\\nbetween managerial ownership and firm performance. De Angelo and De Angelo (1985) followed the \\\\nagency theory perspective mentioning that high level of manage rial ownership will entrench \\\\nmanagement and create agency problems. Morck et al. (1988) and Shleifer and Vishny (1997) \\\\nanticipate the potential of exploitation of firm results by management to favor themselves. Becht et al. \\\\n(2005) argue that stock options might allow CEOs to enrich themselves and expropriate shareholders. \\\\nSome other scholars find that managerial ownership is endogenously determined (Demsetz  & Lehn, \\\\n1985; Loderer  & Martin, 1997; Cho, 1998).  \\\\n \\\\nIn spite of some questionable results, there is an  extensive number of studies supporting the notion that \\\\ndirector ownership helps in aligning the owners‟ and the management in terests, and provides a way of \\\\nmonitoring risk taking behavior of managers (Fama , 1980 ; Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Bebchuk, et al. , \\\\n2002; Chung and Pruitt, 1996; Core, Holthausen  & Larcker, 1999; Becht et al., 2005). Also, as argued \\\\nby Shleifer  &Vishny, 1996, aligning interests could alleviate free -ride problem of monitoring to boost \\\\nboard effectiveness. Nonetheless, the stewardship theory denies the existence of conflict of interests \\\\nbetween directors or managers and shareholders. It rather argued that both of them unite their interests \\\\nwith organizational goals (Donaldson & Davis, 1994; Davis et al., 1997).  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n7 \\\\n  \\\\nTherefore, it could be depicted that firm performance would be improved if directors and shareholders‟ \\\\ninterests are aligned through director ownership. Accordingly, the first hypothesis for this study states \\\\nthat: \\\\n \\\\nH5: Director Ownership is positively associated with firm perfo rmance.  \\\\n \\\\n4. Conceptual framework  \\\\n \\\\nThis section will explore various board characteristics that are expected to have an effect on firm \\\\nfinancial performance based on the literature review that was illustrated earlier.  Figure 1.1 presents the \\\\nconceptual framewo rk of this study. On the left hand -side, there are the listed board  characteristics \\\\nnamely, board independence, board meetings, CEO duality, director ownership, and board size. These \\\\nvariables are related to the firm performance, shown on the right hand si de, which is measured by return \\\\non equity, return on assets and Tobin‟s q. The relationship between board characteristics and the firm \\\\nperformance is controlled by firm size, firm age and firm leverage.  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n8 \\\\n Independent Variables          Dependant  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n5.

Furthermore, \\\\ntargeting the most active 50 companies ensures both statistical power in the tests and maximum data \\\\navailability. These companies cover about 15 industries, banks, and financial institutions are omitted as \\\\nthis sector has particular governance  issues which make it different from all other sectors (Faccio and \\\\nLasfer , 2000).  Firms‟ samples covered industries like Building material and construction , chemicals, \\\\nCommunication,  industrial goods and services and automobiles,  Entertainment and tourism , food and \\\\nbeverage , housing  and real estate, and information  technology.  Through doing this, a sample of 56 \\\\nEgyptian firms was obtained for a period of nine years.  \\\\n \\\\nThe sample selected represent firms which are considered top enterprises in Egypt, they are  likely to \\\\nhave greater potential to attract and employ competent and skilled individuals on the board and in the \\\\nsame way to gain a pay -off from such well -constructed board besides it is expected that these firms \\\\nhave good access to capital and other reso urces that are necessary not only for survival but also for \\\\nenhancing their performance.  \\\\n \\\\n5.2 Data collection  \\\\n \\\\nThe data for this study comes from multiple sources of secondary data. The base data comes from the \\\\nannual disclosure book issued by  the Egyptian  stock exchange  (EGX) . This book identifies the most \\\\nactive listed companies in Egypt & contains data on board characteristics, ownership structure, \\\\ncorporate performance & other related variables.  This book contains the annual reports of the 50 most \\\\nactive companies listed in Egypt\\\\'s stock exchange of that year. The annual reports were used in \\\\ncalculating the variables of board characteristics and firm performance. For this research, the disclosure \\\\nbooks for years 2004 –12 were used.  The use of the financia l statements of the most active companies \\\\nis due to data availability & reliability because these are required by law & are issued by the Egyptian \\\\ncapital market authority.  \\\\n \\\\n6. Results and discussion  \\\\n \\\\n6.1 Descriptive statistics  \\\\n \\\\nThe descriptive statistics for  all variables are presented in Table 2. This study sample shows a high \\\\npercentage of independence in the board of directors – at around 65%. This percentage shows a \\\\nrelatively high compliance rate with the Egyptian corporate governance recommendations on board \\\\nindependence of maintaining a majority of non -executive directors on the board. The average board \\\\nmeetings is about 4 times (mean = 4.44), which is the minimum number of meetings as recommended \\\\nby the ECCG. Also, the study shows that 71.42% of our sa mple has the same person as the chairman \\\\nof the board and the CEO, which is against the Egyptian corporate governance recommendations where \\\\nit is recommended that the positions be split into two roles or, in other words, that the two roles should \\\\nbe held b y two different persons. In most of the firms in the sample, top management appears not to \\\\nhave significant ownership, with a mean of 8.5%. This is considered a relatively small percentage. The \\\\naverage board size is about 9 members (mean = 9.33). The board  size in Egypt appears to be smaller \\\\nthan the board size in the US (eg mean size of 11.45 in Bhagat & Black, 2002) but larger than the size \\\\nof boards in Australia (eg mean size of 6.6 in Kiel & Nicholson, 2003). The board size in Egypt is larger \\\\nthan in th e UK as stated by Peasnell et al. (2005), who reports a mean board size of around 8 members.  \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n11 \\\\n  \\\\nTable 2: Descriptive statistics  \\\\nVariables*  Mean  Std. \\\\nDev.

The correlation coefficients are checked for the presence of high \\\\ncollin earity amongst regressors. Table 3 presents the Pearson correlations with the ROA; table 4 \\\\npresents both the Pearson correlations with the ROE; and Tobin‟s Q will be presented in table 5. \\\\n \\\\nFrom the correlation coefficients shown in table 3, 4 and 5, no hig h correlation is found amongst the \\\\nvariables. As a result, collinearity does not appear to create a threat to the interpretation of regression \\\\ncoefficients of the independent variables in this model.

Conclusion  \\\\n \\\\nThe overall  aim of this research is to interpret the relationship between the board characteristics and \\\\nthe firm performance represented by the ROA, ROE and Tobin‟s Q. Inconsistent with the first \\\\nhypothesis that states there is a positive relationship between the pro portion of independent \\\\ndirectors on the board and firm financial performance as measured by ROE , ROA and Tobin‟s Q , the \\\\nresults showed that there is a positive but not significant relationship with ROE , ROA  and Tobin‟s Q ; \\\\nthis implies that the outside inde pendent directors cannot influence firms‟ financial performance.  This \\\\nstudy finds that board size (second hypothesis) is positively and significantly associated with ROE \\\\nand ROA, which is consistent with this study‟s argument, but this hypothesis is not su pported for the \\\\nTobin‟s Q.  \\\\n \\\\nThe third hypothesis predicts that CEO duality is negatively associated with the firm financial \\\\nperformance. The positively signed coefficient and the significant relationship showed in the results \\\\nreject this study‟s argument a nd hypothesis with regard to ROE, ROA and Tobin‟s Q. The fourth  \\\\nhypothesis reflects that as board meetings frequency increase, the firm financial performance will \\\\nincrease, this hypothesis is supported with regard to ROE but not supported for the ROA and T obin‟s \\\\nQ. The fifth hypothesis predicts that the relationship between the director ownership and the \\\\ncompany financial performance is positive. The study results showed that there is a positive but not \\\\nsignificant relationship between ROE and ROA and the d irectors‟ ownership. Also the relationship \\\\nbetween the director ownership and Tobin‟s Q  is negative but not significant; t herefore , this \\\\nhypothesis is rejected . \\\\n \\\\nThe firm size as a control variable  has a positive significant relationship with ROE  and ROA , this \\\\nresult supports claims in prior studies that higher firm performance is associated with larger sized \\\\nfirms , but the relation is negative with the Tobin‟s Q . While, Firm age showed an insignificant \\\\nnegative relationship  with ROE and ROA but the relatio n is significant with the Tobin‟s Q.  The firm \\\\nleverage  showed a positive but not significant relationship with ROE , negative and significant \\\\nrelationship with ROA, and positive significant with Tobin‟s Q.  \\\\n \\\\nAcknowledgment  \\\\n \\\\nThis research paper is based upon  a PhD thesis that will be submitted by Mrwan Amer  to Cardiff \\\\nMetropolitan University.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n20 \\\\n References  \\\\n \\\\n- Abdullah, S.

These policies have been consistently followed for all presented periods, except for re -\\\\nmeasurement of financial assets and recognition of profits and losses arising during the comparative \\\\nperiod.  \\\\n(A) Investment in subsidiaries and associates  \\\\nA/1 Subsidiaries  \\\\nSubsidiaries are entities that ADIB has the ability to directly or indirectly control its financial and \\\\noperating policies, and ADIB usually has ownership share that exceeds one -half of the voting rights. \\\\nThis takes into consideration the impact of the fut ure voting rights, which  can be exercised or converted \\\\nat the current time when evaluating ADIB’s ability to control the subsidiaries . \\\\n \\\\nA/2 Associates  \\\\nAssociates are all entities in which ADIB has directly or indirectly significant influence, which does not \\\\nreach the limit of control, and ADIB usually owns between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.  \\\\nThe purchasing method is used by ADIB to account for the acquisition of companies. Acquisition cost \\\\nis measured at fair value or the consideration provided by A DIB for the assets of purchase and/or issued \\\\nequity instruments and/or liabilities incurred by ADIB and/or liabilities assumed by ADIB on behalf of \\\\nacquire , at the date of exchange plus any costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Net assets including \\\\nidentifiable contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. Irrespective to \\\\nthe existence of non -controlling Profit s, the excess in acquisition cost over ADIBs’ share of the fair \\\\nvalue in the net assets acquired is considered as goodwill. If the acquisition cost is less than the fair value \\\\nof the net assets, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of incom e within the item \\\"Other \\\\noperating income / (expenses)”.  \\\\nAssociates and subsidiaries at ADIB’s separate financial statements are accounted for using the cost \\\\nmethod. According to this method, investments are recognized  at the cost of acquisition, including  \\\\ngoodwill, less any impairment loss. Dividends are recognized  in the statement of income, when the \\\\ndividends are approved to be distributed and ADIB\\\\'s right of collection is established.  \\\\n \\\\n(B) Operating Sectors  \\\\nThe operating sectors participating in ADIB\\\\'s business activities are reported in line with the internal \\\\nreports submitted to ADIB\\\\'s department Chief Operating Decision Maker, considering that the \\\\nmanagement represented in the Board of Directors, the Executive Management and the relevant \\\\ncommittees / or its designee at the foreign branches is responsible for making operational decisions  about \\\\nthe resources to be allocated to the operating sectors and assessing their performance.\\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n13 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies – continued  \\\\n \\\\n (C) Sectors reporting  \\\\nAn activity sector is a group of assets and processes associated with the provision of products or services \\\\nthat are characterized by risks and benefits and differ from those of other sectors of activity. The \\\\ngeographical sector is engaged in the provision of products or services within a single economic \\\\nenvironment with risks and benefits t hat are related to geographical sectors operating in a different \\\\neconomic environment.  \\\\nADIB is divided into two main sectors: Corporate Banking Services and Retail Banking for Individuals. \\\\nIn addition, the Corporate Centre is a central funding department f or ADIB\\\\'s core business. For the \\\\ndealings of the department of transactions, investment activity and other non -core activities, they are \\\\nreported within the Corporate Banking Services  \\\\nFor the purpose of sectors reporting in accordance with the classificati on of geographic regions, the \\\\nSector\\\\'s profits, loss es, assets and liabilities are presented on a basis of branches’ locations.  \\\\nBased on the fact that ADIB (ADIB - Egypt) does not have an entity to register abroad, the sectors report  \\\\npresent, unless otherw ise stated in a certain disclosure, all ADIB\\\\'s investments in equity instruments and \\\\ndebt instruments issued by foreign institutions, as well as, credit facilities granted by ADIB to foreign \\\\nparties based on the location of the local branch in which such a ssets are registered.  \\\\n \\\\n(D) Foreign currency translation  \\\\nD/1 Functional and presentation currency  \\\\nThe financial statements of ADIB are presented using the currency of the primary economic environment \\\\nin which ADIB exercises its business (the functional currency). ADIB\\\\'s financial statements are \\\\npresented in Egyptian pounds, which is ADIB\\\\'s functi onal and presentation currency.  \\\\nD/2 Transactions and balances in foreign currencies  \\\\nADIB keeps its accounting records in Egyptian pound. Foreign currency transac tions during the financial \\\\nperiod / year are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. All monetary \\\\nassets and liabilities balances in foreign currencies at the end of the financial year are re -translated based \\\\non the e xchange rates prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement \\\\nof such transactions and translation differences are recognized  in the statement of profit and loss under \\\\nthe following items:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Net trading income or net income from financial instruments classified at fair value through profit \\\\nor loss for trading assets / liabilities or those classified at fair value through profit or loss based on \\\\nclassification of the asset or liability.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Within other comprehensive income  items of equity with regard to Islamic futures exchange \\\\ncontracts / Islamic currency swap contracts as qualifying hedge (eligible) for cash flows or as \\\\nqualifying hedge for net investment.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Within other comprehensive income items of equity for financial in vestments of equity instruments \\\\nat fair value through other comprehensive income.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Other operating income (expenses) for the remaining items.\\\\n--- Page 14 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n14 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\nChanges in the fair value of monetary financial  instruments in foreign currency classified as investments \\\\nat fair value are analyzed  within the other comprehensive income through differences from changes in \\\\namortized  costs of the instrument, differences from changes in the prevailing exchange rates, an d \\\\ndifferences from changes in the fair value of the instrument. Differences related to changes in the \\\\namortized  cost are recognized  into statement of profit and loss under funds and similar revenues, and \\\\nthose related to the changes in the exchange rates u nder other operating income (expenses). Differences \\\\nfrom changes in the fair value (fair value reserve/ financial investments at fair value through other \\\\ncomprehensive income) are recognized  within equity of comprehensive income items.  \\\\nValuation difference s result from non -cash items include profit and loss from change in fair value such \\\\nas equity instruments at fair value through profit and loss. Valuation differences result from equity \\\\ninstruments classified as financial investments at fair value through comprehensive income statement \\\\nare recognized  in statement  of other comprehensive income.  \\\\nE) Financial assets and financial liabilities  \\\\nE/1. Initial recognition and measurement  \\\\nADIB conducts initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities on the date on which ADIB becomes \\\\na party to the contractual conditions of financial instrument.  \\\\nThe financial asset or liability is initially measured at fair value. With regard to ass et or liability that is \\\\nnot subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss, it would be measured at fair value plus \\\\ncost of transaction that is connected directl y with acquisition or issuance.  \\\\nE/2. Classification  \\\\nFinancial assets - Applicable Policy as of January 1, 2019  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Upon initial recognition, ADIB classifies the financial assets into financial assets at amortized  cost, \\\\nfinancial assets at fair value through statement of other comprehensive income or at fair value \\\\nthrough profit and loss.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial asset is measured at amortized  cost upon fulfilment of the following two conditions \\\\nand when it has not been allocated by Bank’s management upon initial recognition at fair value \\\\nthrough profit and loss:  \\\\n- The financial asset is held within a bus iness model whose purpose is to hold financial asset to \\\\ncollect contractual cash flows.  \\\\n- The contractual conditions of financial asset result, on specific dates, in contractual cash flows \\\\nfor the asset and is represented only in the principal amount of the financial instrument and the \\\\nProfit .  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income upon fulfilment \\\\nof the following two conditions and when it has not been allocated upon initial recognition at fair \\\\nvalue through profit and loss:  \\\\n- The financial asset is held within a business model whose purpose is to collect contractual cash \\\\nflows and sell the financial asset.  \\\\n- The contractual conditions of financial asset result, on specific dates, in contractual cash flows \\\\nfor the asset and is not represent only in the principal debt and the Profit . \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Upon initial recognition of an equity instrument not held for trading, ADIB can take irrevocable \\\\noption to present subsequent changes in fair value through statement of other comprehensive inc ome. \\\\nSuch option is adopted for each investment individually.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 15 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n15 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies -

Such information, which is \\\\ntaken into consi deration when evaluating the business model, includes the following:  \\\\n- Documented approved policies and portfolio’s objectives and application of such policies in the real \\\\nworld. In particular, whether the management’s strategy focuses only upon collection o f contractual \\\\ncash flows and holding a definite Profit  rate to compare maturity dates of financial assets with \\\\nmaturity dates of liabilities that fund such assets or generates cash flows from sale of assets.  \\\\n- Way of evaluating and reporting on portfolio’s performance to senior management.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 17 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n17 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\n- Risks that affect business model performance including nature of financial assets held in such model \\\\nand the way of managing such risks.  \\\\n- Way of evaluating the performance of busi ness managers (fair value and/or Profit  on portfolio).  \\\\n- Periodic, value and date of sale transactions in previous periods, reasons of such transactions, and \\\\nforecasts regarding future sale activities. However, information regarding sale activities is not t aken \\\\ninto consideration separately but as a part of a whole comprehensive valuation of how to achieve \\\\nADIB’s objective from managing the financial assets and how to generate cash flows.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial assets held for trading, or managed and its performance  valued on basis of fair value \\\\nare measured at fair value through profit and loss since they are not held to collect contractual cash \\\\nflows or to collect contractual cash flows and sell financial assets together.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Valuation of whether the contractual cash flows of an asset represent payments restricted \\\\nupon principal amount of instrument and Profit    \\\\n-  For purpose of this valuation, ADIB identifies the principal amount of financial instrument as the \\\\nfair value of financial asset upon initial recognition. Fur ther, ADIB identifies the Profit  as time value \\\\nfor money and credit risks related to the principal amount during specific period and other main \\\\nfinance risks and costs (such as liquidity risks and administrative costs) in addition to profit margin.  \\\\n- In order to evaluate whether the contractual cash flows of the asset are represented in payments \\\\nrestricted upon the principal of financial instrument and Profit , ADIB takes into its consideration \\\\nthe contractual conditions of the instrument. This includes  valuation of whether the financial asset \\\\nincludes contractual conditions that may change date or amount of contractual cash flows which \\\\nresult in breach of this condition. In order to carry out such valuation, ADIB takes into consideration \\\\nthe following m atters:  \\\\n- Potential events that may change the amount or date of cash flows.  \\\\n- Specifications of financial leverage ( Profit  rate, terms, currency type ...).  \\\\n- Terms of accelerated payment and term extension.  \\\\n- Terms that may limit ADIB’s ability to claim cash flows from certain assets.  \\\\n- Specifications that may be amended for time value of cash (periodically repricing Profit  rate).  \\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n18 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\nFinancial liabilities  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Upon initial recognition, ADIB classifies financial liabilities into financial liabilities at amortised \\\\ncost and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss according to purpose of bank’s \\\\nbusiness model.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 All financial liabilities at fair value are initially recognised on the date when ADIB becomes party \\\\nto contractual conditions of financial instrument.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Classified financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost based on amortised cost \\\\nby using effective Profit  rate. \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities at fair value through prof it and loss are subsequently measured at fair value \\\\nand change in fair value related to change in credit rating degree of ADIB is recognised in \\\\nstatement of other comprehensive income whilst the outstanding amount from change in fair value \\\\nis presented in profit and loss.  \\\\nReclassification  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial assets are reclassified upon initial recognition only if ADIB changes business model \\\\nof managing such assets.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 In all cases, reclassification between financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss  and \\\\nfinancial liabilities at amortised cost are not conducted.  \\\\nC/3. Exclusion  \\\\n1- Financial assets  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial asset is excluded when the effective period of contractual right to obtain cash flows from \\\\nfinancial asset expires or ADIB transfers the right to receive contractual cash flows in a transaction whereby \\\\nthe risks and benefits associated materially with ownership are transferred to another party.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When a financial asset is excluded, difference between asset’s book value (or book value allocated to part  \\\\nof the excluded principal) and total of received consideration (including any new asset obtained less any \\\\nnew commitment incurred) and any consolidated profit and loss has been previously recognised in the fair \\\\nvalue reserve of financial investments at fa ir value through statement of other comprehensive income is \\\\nrecognised in statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 As of 1 January 2019, any accumulated profit or loss recognised in statement of other comprehensive \\\\nincome related to investing in equity instruments a llocated as investments at fair value through statement \\\\nof other comprehensive income are not recognised in profit and loss upon disposal of such asset. Any share \\\\nresulted or held from the asset qualified for disposal (eligible for disposal) is recognised as separate asset \\\\nor liability.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When ADIB makes transactions whereby it transfers assets that have been previously recognised in \\\\nstatement of financial position, but materially held most of risks and benefits associated with the transferred \\\\nasset or part o f it. In such cases, the transferred asset is not excluded.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 In respect of transactions in which ADIB does not materially hold or transfer all risks and benefits \\\\nassociated with asset ownership and hold control over the asset, ADIB continues to recognise t he asset \\\\nwithin the limitation of its continuous commitment to financial asset. The continuous commitment of ADIB \\\\nto the financial asset is determined based on ADIB’s exposure to the changes in the value of transferred \\\\nasset.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 In some transactions, ADIB holds the commitment to provide transferred asset in return for commission. \\\\nThereupon, the transferred asset is excluded if it meets the exclusion conditions. An asset or liability to \\\\nprovide service is recognised if the service commission is higher than t he appropriate amount (asset) or less \\\\nthan the appropriate amount (liability) to perform the service.  \\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n19 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\n2- Financial liabilities  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB excludes financial liabilities when the financial liability is disposed of or cancelled or its term \\\\nset forth in the contract expires.  \\\\nC/4. Adjustments to financial assets and financial liabilities  \\\\n1- Financial assets  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7  If the terms of a financial asset are amended, ADIB evaluates whether the cash flows of adjusted \\\\nasset are materially different. If the cash flows materially differ, the contractual rights of cash flows \\\\nfrom the original financial asset are considered exp ired and hence the original financial asset is \\\\nexcluded and the new financial asset is recognised at fair value and the value resulting from \\\\nadjusting aggregate book value is recognised as profits or losses under profits and losses. On the \\\\nother hand, if s uch adjustment has occurred due to financial difficulties of the borrower, the profits \\\\nhave to be deferred and presented with aggregate impairment losses whilst losses have to be \\\\nrecognised in the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 If the cash flows of adjusted  asset recognised at amortised cost do not materially differ, the \\\\nadjustment will not result in the exclusion of the financial asset.  \\\\n2- Financial liabilities  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB may adjust a financial liability when its terms are amended and the cash flows of adjusted \\\\nliability will materially differ. In such case, a new financial asset is recognised according to the \\\\namended terms at fair value. The difference between book value of old financial liability and new \\\\nfinancial liability is recognised in accordance with amended terms in the profit and loss.  \\\\n \\\\nH) Offsetting financial assets and liabilities  \\\\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the \\\\nrecognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the \\\\nliability simultaneously.  \\\\n \\\\nAn offset is made only between revenues and expenses, if permitted in accordance with the amended \\\\nEgyptian Accounting Standards, or profit or loss result from similar groups because of trading \\\\nactivity or the result of translation differences of the balances of assets and liabilities of monetary \\\\nnature into foreign currency or the result of profits (losses) from foreign currency operations.  \\\\n \\\\nI) Measurement of fair value  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB sets the fair value on bas is that it is the price that will be obtained for the sale of an asset or \\\\nwill be paid for transfer of a liability in a transaction made between the participants in the market \\\\non measurement date taking specifications of the asset or liability into conside ration when \\\\nmeasuring the fair value if the participants in the market took such specifications into consideration \\\\nwhen pricing the asset and/or liability on measurement date as such specifications include status \\\\nand position of the asset and restrictions upon sale or use of the asset as per the perspective of \\\\nparticipants in the market.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 20 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n20 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB uses market methodology to determine fair value of financial assets and liabilities as such \\\\nmethodology uses other relevant prices and information result from market transactions that include \\\\nassets or liabilities or set of assets and liabilities and are typical or comparable. Accordingly, ADIB \\\\nuses valuation methods that are in consistent with m arket methodology such as market multiples \\\\nderived from comparable sets. Thereupon, it is required to opt for the appropriate multiplier within \\\\nrange using personal judgement taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors \\\\nof the measur ement.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When it cannot  be relied upon the market approach to determine the fair value of a financial asset \\\\nor financial liability, ADIB uses the income approach to determine fair value whereby future \\\\npayments such as cash flow or income and expenses are tr ansferred to current amount (discounted) \\\\nso that the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about future payments.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When it cannot  be relied upon market approach or income approach to determine the fair value of a \\\\nfinancial asset or fi nancial liability, ADIB uses the cost method to determine fair value in order to \\\\nreflect the amount currently claimed to replace the asset in its current state (the current replacement \\\\ncost) so that the fair value reflects the cost incurred by the particip ant in the market as a buyer of \\\\nacquiring an alternative asset of similar benefits since the participant in the market as a buyer will \\\\nnot pay for an asset more than the amount that replaces benefit of the asset.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The measurement method of financial assets and liabilities at fair value are set below in the financial \\\\nstatements within the hierarchy of the fair value, based on the input levels that are considered to be \\\\nsignificant to the fair value measurement as a whole  \\\\n \\\\n- Level 1 - Inputs of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, \\\\nwhich ADIB can have access to at the date of measurement.  \\\\n- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or \\\\nliability, either directl y or indirectly.  \\\\n- Level 3 - Unobservable inputs of the asset or the liability.  \\\\nThe following table shows the change in the measurement methods of the fair value of financial assets \\\\nat 31 December 2023, compared to the comparative figures at 31 December 2022 \\\\n \\\\n (E/1) Financial instruments at level 1  \\\\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted prices at the date of \\\\nstatement of financial statements. The market is deemed active when the items in the market are similar \\\\nand there are usual buyers and sellers willing to deal at any time normally.  ADIB has used the declared \\\\nquoted price to determine the fair value of this level. The instruments included in Level 1 comprise \\\\ninvestments held for trading in the st ock exchanges.  \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n21 \\\\n (E/2) Financial instruments at level 2  \\\\nThe fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using \\\\nvaluation techniques. These valuation techniques depend  on the use of observable inputs of the asset \\\\nor the liability directly or indirectly. The fair value method is included in the second level if all \\\\nsignificant inputs are observable throughout the period of the financial asset or liability. If an important  \\\\ninput is not observable, the financial instrument will be included in the third level.  \\\\nSpecific valuation techniques used to determine fair values of financial instruments include:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Profit  rate swaps by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on \\\\nobservable Profit  curves.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using the current value of the \\\\nexpected cash flows by using the future for eign exchange of the currency of contract.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Analysis of deducted cash flows to determine fair values of other financial instruments.  \\\\n \\\\nJ) Profit  income and expenses  \\\\n- Profit  income and expense for all Profit -bearing financial instruments, except for those classified as \\\\nheld for trading or designated initially at fair value through profit and loss, are recognised in the \\\\nstatement of profit and loss within ‘ Profit  of similar funds and revenues\\\\' using the effective Profit  \\\\nmethod.  \\\\n \\\\n- According to the effective Profit rate method, the amortised cost of an asset or financial liability is \\\\ncalculated and allocation of income revenues or expenses Profit  is distributed throughout the life of \\\\nrelated instrument. The effective Profit  rate represents the rate used to disco unt future cash flows \\\\nexpected to be paid or collected during the expected life of the financial instrument, or less time if \\\\nappropriate in order to accurately determine the book value of an asset or financial liability. When \\\\ncalculating the effective Profit rate, ADIB estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of \\\\nthe financial instrument (for example, early payment options) but does not consider future credit \\\\nlosses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the cont ract that are \\\\nconsidered as part of the effective Profit  rate. Also, the transaction cost includes any premiums or \\\\ndiscounts.  \\\\n \\\\n- When funds or receivables are classified as impaired funds and debts, the related Profit  income is \\\\nnot recognised but is rather c arried off the financial statements in marginal records and is recognised \\\\nunder revenues according to cash basis as per the following:  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 When they are collected, after receiving all past due instalments for consumption and real estate \\\\nfunds for personal housing and small funds for economic activities.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 For corporate funds, cash basis is also applied, where the Profit  subsequently calculated is given in \\\\naccordance with the fund scheduling contract, until 25% of the scheduling instalments are repaid \\\\nand with  a minimum of one year of regular repayment. In case the customer continues to make \\\\npayments on a regular basis, the Profit  calculated on the fund outstanding is recognised in revenues \\\\n(Profit  on regular scheduling balance) without marginal Profit  before s cheduling which is not \\\\nrecognised as revenues except after paying all the fund balance in the balance sheet before \\\\nscheduling.  \\\\n--- Page 22 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n22 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies – continued  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nK) Fees and commission income  \\\\n \\\\n- Fees that are due for a banking process or fund service or a facility are recognised as revenues \\\\nwhen the service is rendered. The recognition of the fees and commissions income related to \\\\nimpaired funds or debts is suspended and they are carried in margin al records off the balance sheet \\\\nand are recognised under revenues according to the cash basis when Profit  income is recognised \\\\nin accordance with item (2 -I). Fees that generally represent a complementing part of the financial \\\\nasset effective rate are reco gnised as adjustment to the effective Profit  rate. \\\\n \\\\n- Commitment fees on funds are deferred when there is probability that funds will be used, as the \\\\ncommitment fees received by ADIB represent compensation for the continuous interference to \\\\nacquire the finan cial instrument. Subsequently, it is recognised as adjustment to the effective Profit  \\\\nrate on funds. If the commitment period passes without issuing the fund, the commitment fees are \\\\nrecognised as income at the end of the commitment period. If there is no probability that these \\\\nfunds are used, the commitment fees are recognized on the basis of the relative time distribution \\\\nover the period of the commitment . \\\\n \\\\n- Fees related to debt instruments measured at its fair value are recognised as income at initial \\\\nrecognition. Fees related to marketing of syndicated funds are recognised as income when the \\\\nmarketing process is completed and the fund is fully used or if ADI B kept its share of the \\\\nsyndicated funds using the effective Profit  rate as used by the other participants.  \\\\n \\\\n- Fees and commissions arising from negotiation or participating in negotiation over a transaction \\\\nin favour of another party -such as arrangement to  buy shares or other financial instruments or \\\\nacquire or sell entities, are recognised in statement of profit and loss upon the completion of the \\\\nconcerned transaction. Fees of management consultation and other services are usually recognised \\\\non a time -apportion basis over the period of performing the service. Financial planning and \\\\ncustody services fees provided on long periods are recognised over the period in which the service \\\\nis provided.  \\\\n \\\\nL) Dividends income  \\\\n- Dividends on ADIB\\\\'s investments in equity instruments and its equivalents are recognised in the \\\\nstatement of profit and loss when the right to collect them is established.   \\\\n \\\\nM) Purchase and resale agreements & sale and repurchase agreements  \\\\n- Sold financial in struments under repurchase agreements are presented within assets in the \\\\ntreasury bills and other government securities line item in the financial position.

This evaluation is mad e periodically at the level of the \\\\ncounterparty. Criteria used are periodically reviewed and monitored to determine the significant \\\\nincrease in credit risk by the credit risk department.  \\\\n- At the date of the financial statements, ADIB estimates the impairmen t loss for financial \\\\ninstruments at a value equal to the expected credit losses over the life of the financial instrument \\\\nexcept for the following cases where the provision for impairment losses is estimated at a value \\\\nequal to the expected credit losses o ver the (12) twelve months:  \\\\n- A debt instrument that has been identified as having low credit risk at the financial statements date \\\\n(debt instruments in the stage (1)).  \\\\n- Other financial instruments whose credit risk at the reporting date has not increased sig nificantly \\\\nsince the initial recognition (debt instruments in the stage (1)).  \\\\n- ADIB considers the expected credit losses to be a probability -weighted estimate of the expected \\\\ncredit losses, which are measured as follows:  \\\\n- The expected credit losses on financ ial assets are measured at the stage (1) based on the present \\\\nvalue of the total cash deficit calculated on the basis of the historical probability of default \\\\nscenarios, which are adjusted according to the average forecasts of the scenarios of \\\\nmacroeconomi c indicators for the future (12) twelve months multiplied by the value at default, \\\\ntaking into account the expected recovery rates upon calculating the loss rate for each group of \\\\ndebt instruments with similar credit risk. As expected credit losses take in to account the amount \\\\nand timing of payments, the credit losses arise even if the enterprise expects full repayment but \\\\nlater on after the debt becomes payable under contractual terms. The expected credit losses over \\\\n(12) twelve -month period will be deemed  a part of the expected credit losses over the life of the \\\\nasset which result from defaults on a financial instrument within (12) twelve months after the date \\\\nof the financial statements.  \\\\n- The expected credit losses on financial assets are measured at the s tage (2) based on the present \\\\nvalue of the total cash deficit calculated on the basis of the historical probability of default \\\\nscenarios and adjusted by the average forecasts of macroeconomic indicators for the life of the \\\\nfinancial asset multiplied by the  value at default, taking into account the expected recovery rates \\\\nupon calculating the loss rate for each group of debt instruments with similar credit risk.  \\\\n- Impaired financial assets at the financial statements date are measured as the difference between  \\\\nthe total book value of the asset and the present value of the expected future cash flows.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Commitments on funds and similar debt instruments are included in the calculation of value upon \\\\ndefault. They are calculated on the balances outstanding on the date of the financial statements \\\\nafter they have been converted into value in the event that these commitments are used in the \\\\nfuture.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Upon calculating loss rates, ADIB calculates the expected recovery rates from the present value \\\\nof the expected cash flo ws either from cash and in kind collateral; or historical or expected future \\\\npayment rates as follows:  \\\\n- For debt instruments classified in stage (1), it is taken into account the value of cash collateral and \\\\nequivalents represented in cash and other financ ial instruments that may be easily converted into \\\\ncash within a short period of time (3 months or less) and without any change (loss) in value as a \\\\nresult of credit risk after deducting 10% for the unexpected circumstances.  \\\\n- For the debt instruments classif ied in the stages (2) and (3), only the types of guarantees will be \\\\nconsidered in accordance with the rules issued by the (CBE) dated 24/5/2005 regarding the \\\\ndetermination of the creditworthiness of the customers and formation of the provisions, while the \\\\nvalue of such guarantees will be calculated according to the rules of preparing and presenting the \\\\nfinancial statements of the banks, the recognition and measurement bases issued by the (CBE) \\\\ndated 16 December 2008, after deducting 10% and 20% of the cash collateral and the present value \\\\nof the future cash flows of the in -kind collateral, respectively.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 27 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n27 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\nMeasurement of expected credit losses - continued  \\\\n- For debt instruments held by banks operating outside Egypt,  the probability rates of default are \\\\ndetermined on the basis of the credit rating of the headquarters of ADIB operating outside of Egypt \\\\nin no more than the credit rating of the country of the headquarters, taking into consideration the \\\\ninstructions issue d by the Central Bank of Egypt on the risks of countries.

The \\\\nexpected credit losses are calculated over the life of the instrument.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7  If restructuring results in exclusion of the current asset, the expect ed fair value of the new asset \\\\nwill be deemed as final cash flows from the current financial asset upon exclusion. This value will \\\\nbe used to calculate the cash deficit from the current financial asset, which is deducted from the \\\\nexpected date of the asset  exclusion at the financial statements date using the original effective \\\\nProfit  rate of the current financial asset.  \\\\n \\\\nPresentation of the expected credit losses provisions in the statement of financial position  \\\\n- The provision for expected credit losses is p resented in the statement of financial position as \\\\nfollows:  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Financial assets measured at amortized cost as a deduction from the total book value of the assets.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Financial commitments and financial guarantee contracts as a provision in general.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 When the financial instrument includes both the used and unused permissible limit of the \\\\ninstrument and ADIB cannot determine the expected credit losses of the unused portion separately, \\\\nADIB presents a provision for the loss of the used and unused portion , and the aggregate amount \\\\nwill be presented as a deduction from the total book value for the used portion. Any increase in \\\\nthe loss provision is presented on the total amount of the used portion as a provision of the unused \\\\nportion.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 A provision for impairment of debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income \\\\nis not recognized in the statement of financial position because the book value of such assets is \\\\ntheir fair value.

Direct c osts also include the cost of the staff involved in upgrading the \\\\nsoftware in addition to a reasonable portion of relative overheads.  \\\\n- The expenses which lead to the increase or expansion in the performance of computer software \\\\nbeyond their original specifi cations are recognised as a development cost and are added to the \\\\noriginal software cost, when all the following conditions are fulfilled:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB has the intention and the ability to c omplete and use that  software.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Development -related expenditures can be reliably measured.  \\\\n- The computer software cost recognised as an asset is amortised over the expected useful life as \\\\nfollows:  \\\\n \\\\nAsset type  Default Life / deprecation rate  \\\\nComputer Software  3 years  \\\\n \\\\nO/ 2 Other intangible assets  \\\\n- Other intangible assets comprise all intangible assets other than goodwill and computer software.  \\\\n- Other intangible assets are recognised at cost of acquisition and amortised on a straight -line basis \\\\nor on the basis of expected economic benefits over the estimated useful lives. As sets that do not \\\\nhave a definite useful life are not amortised, but impairment is tested annually and the impairment \\\\nvalue (if any) is charged to the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n \\\\nP) Fixed assets  \\\\n- Lands and buildings are primarily represented in head offices,  branches and offices. All assets are \\\\npresented at historical cost less depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes \\\\nexpenses associated directly with acquiring fixed assets items.  \\\\n- Subsequent costs are recognised in the asset’s carrying amo unt or are recognised as a separate \\\\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the \\\\nasset will flow to the Bank and the cost can be measured reliably. Main tenance and repair expenses \\\\nare charged to other op erating expenses during the period / year in which they are incurred.  \\\\n- Lands are not depreciated.

Depreciable Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events \\\\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recovered. An asset’s \\\\ncarrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable value if the asset’s carrying \\\\namount exceeds it s estimated recoverable amount.  \\\\n- The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s net selling amount and value in use. Profits \\\\nand losses on disposals from fixed assets are determined by comparing net proceeds with carrying \\\\namount. Profits/ (losses) are included in other operating income (expenses) in the statement of \\\\nprofit and loss.  \\\\n \\\\nQ) Impairment of non -financial assets  \\\\n- Assets that do not have definite life time are not depreciated and their impairment is reviewed \\\\nannually.  Impairment of depreciated assets is examined when there are events or changes in \\\\ncircumstances that indicate that the book value may be partially or wholly non -recoverable.  \\\\n \\\\n- Impairment loss is recognised and the asset value is deducted at the amount by which the asset’s \\\\nbook value increases over the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount represents the higher \\\\nof the asset’s net selling amount and value in use. For the purpose of estimating impairment, the \\\\nasset is grouped to the smallest possible cash generating unit. The non -financial assets are \\\\nreviewed for any impairment in order to determine if impairment can be reversed to the statement \\\\nof pro fit and loss at the date of each financial statement.  \\\\n \\\\nR)  Leases  \\\\n- Finance leases are accounted for in accordance with Law 95 of 1995 concerning Finance Lease if \\\\nthe contract grants the right to the lessee to purchase the asset on a specified date and at a specified \\\\nvalue; and the contract period represents at least 75 % of the expected useful life of the asset, or \\\\nthe present value of the total lease payments represents at least 90% of the value of the asset. Other \\\\nleases are considered operating leases.  \\\\n \\\\nR/1 Leasing  \\\\n- Finance lease contracts, lease costs including maintenance expense of leased assets are recognised \\\\nunder expenses in the statement of profit and loss in the year / period incurred. If the Bank decides \\\\nto exercise the right to purchase the leased  assets, the cost of this right of purchase is capitalised \\\\nas an asset within the fixed asset and depreciated over the assets\\\\' expected remaining useful life in \\\\nthe same way used with similar assets.  \\\\n- Payments made under operating leases, less any discounts  received from the lessor, are recognised \\\\nas expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight -line basis over the period of the lease.  \\\\n \\\\nS) Cash and cash equivalents  \\\\n- For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include balances due \\\\nwithin three months from the date of acquisition, which includes cash and balances with central \\\\nbanks other than the statutory reserve, and balances with banks and other government notes.  \\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n31 \\\\n Summary of accounting policie s - continued  \\\\nT) Other provisions  \\\\n- Other provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result \\\\nof past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; \\\\nand the amount has been reliably estimated.  \\\\n- Where there are a number of similar obligations, the outflow required for settlement is determined, \\\\ntaking into consideration the group of obligations as a whole. The provision is recognised even if \\\\nthe likelihood of an outflow wit h respect to an item in the group is minimal.  \\\\n- Provisions no longer required fully or partially are reversed in other operating income (expenses).  \\\\n- The current value of payments to settle the obligations that must be settled after one year from the \\\\nfinancial  position date using an appropriate rate in accordance with the terms of settlement, without \\\\nbeing affected by the prevailing tax rate, which reflects the time value of money. If the settlement \\\\nterm is less than one year, the estimated value of the obligat ion is calculated unless it has a material \\\\nimpact; otherwise, it is calculated at the current value.  \\\\n \\\\nU) Commitments of financing and financial guarantee contracts  \\\\n- Financial guarantees represent contracts in which ADIB is the guarantor or the guarantor of \\\\nfinancing or overdrafts (mudaraba) towards other entities. This requires ADIB to make certain \\\\npayments to compensate the beneficiary for loss incurred due to defaul t of the debtor when \\\\npayment is due in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument. These financial guarantees \\\\nare given to banks, financial institutions and other entities on behalf of ADIB\\\\'s customers.  \\\\n- Commitments on financing are the commitments u nder which the Bank grants credit according to \\\\npre-determined terms and thus guarantees include the unused portions of the credit limits granted \\\\nwithin the amounts expected to be used by ADIB in the future. The financial guarantee contracts \\\\nand commitments  of granting finance at Profit  rates below the market price are initially recognized \\\\nin the financial statements at fair value on the date of granting the guarantee / commitment. The \\\\ninitially recognized fair value is amortized over the life of the guarant ee / commitment.  \\\\n- In subsequent measurement, ADIB\\\\'s obligation under the guarantee / commitment is measured as \\\\nfollows:  \\\\nThe higher of the amortized value or the impairment loss value.  \\\\n- ADIB has not made any commitments during the period / year on finances m easured at fair value \\\\nthrough profit and loss.  \\\\n- For other commitments on finances:  ADIB recognizes impairment losses.  \\\\n- Liabilities arising from financial guarantee contracts are recognized within provisions. Any excess \\\\nof the liability arising from the fina ncial guarantee is recognized in the statement of profit and loss \\\\nwithin other operating revenues (expenses) in the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n- The calculated provision for commitments for financing is recognized as part of the provision for \\\\nimpairment of financing for each debt, to the extent that it equals the value of financing. Any \\\\nincrease in the provision for commitment over finance is recognized within provisions in the \\\\nstatement of financial position.  \\\\n--- Page 32 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n32 \\\\n Summary of accounti ng policies - continued  \\\\nV) Obligations of retirement benefits  \\\\n V/1 Employees\\\\' fund  \\\\n- On the 1st of July 2013, ADIB established a special social insurance fund (the Fund) under Law \\\\nNo. 54 of 1975, \\\"Special Insurance Funds and its Executive Regulations”. ADIB registered the \\\\nFund on 14 January 2014 and the Fund\\\\'s registration number with the Financial Supervisory \\\\nAuthority is (884). The Fund\\\\'s work began on the 1st of April 2014 and the terms o f this Fund and \\\\nits amendments apply on all employees of the headquar ters of ADIB and its branches in the Arab \\\\nRepublic of Egypt.  \\\\n- ADIB is obliged to pay to the Fund the contributions due for each month calculated in accordance \\\\nwith the regulations of the Fund and its amendments , however, there is no obligation on ADIB \\\\nEgypt  if the Fund  is insufficient. The  Fund is financed in general through monthly contributions \\\\nand some other resources set forth in the regulations of the Fund.  \\\\n- Payment of insurance benefits is made in the case of termination of service due to the member\\\\'s \\\\nretirement age, death, whole permanent disability or partial permanent disability from the service. \\\\nIn the event that the term of the membership is less than three years, the member of the Fund is \\\\npaid the final balance of his account corresponding to the c ontributions paid by him to the Fund \\\\non the date of termination of service or membership.  \\\\n V/2 System of defined benefits for the medical care of senior employees during  the period of \\\\nservice and after retirement  \\\\n- ADIB applies the system of medical contribution specified for the senior employees during the \\\\nservice and after retirement. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined \\\\nbenefit plans comprises the present value of the defined benefit liabilities at the balance she et date \\\\nafter deduction of the fair value of the assets of the plan and the deduction (addition) of the \\\\nunrealised actuarial profit (loss) adjustments and the cost of the additional benefits relating to the \\\\nprevious service periods.  \\\\n- The liability of the de fined benefit plans (future cash flows expected to be paid) is calculated by \\\\nan independent actuarial expert using the projected unit credit method.  The present value of the \\\\nobligation of the defined benefit plans is determined by discounting the expected  future cash flows \\\\nusing the Profit  rate of high quality corporate notes or the Profit  rate on government notes bonds \\\\nin the same currency of paying the benefits and with almost the same maturity term of the pension \\\\nbenefit liability.  \\\\n- Gains (losses) arisin g from adjustments and changes in estimates and actuarial assumptions are \\\\ncalculated and the gains are deducted (and losses added) to the statement of income if they do not \\\\nexceed 10% of the asset value of the plan or 10% of the defined benefit liabilities , whichever is \\\\nhigher. In the event of an increase in gains (losses) over this ratio, the increase is deducted (added) \\\\nin the statement of income over the remaining average working years.  \\\\n- Past service costs are recognized directly in the statement of inco me within administrative \\\\nexpenses, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in \\\\nthe service for a specified period of time (Vesting period). In this case, the past servi ce costs are \\\\namortized using straight -line meth od over the vesting period.  \\\\nW) Borrowing  \\\\nADIB’s  financings are initially recognized at fair value less costs to obtain financing. The \\\\nfinancing will be subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the net \\\\nproceeds and the value to be fulfilled over the period of obtaining financing u sing effective Profit  \\\\nmethod will be charged to the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\nX) Comparative figures  \\\\nWhere necessary, comparative figures are reclassified to conform to changes in presentation used \\\\nin the current period . \\\\n--- Page 33 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n33 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies – continued  \\\\nY) Income taxes  \\\\n- The income tax on profit or loss for the period/ year includes both the current and deferred taxes; \\\\nit is recognized in the statement of income except for income tax related to other comprehensive \\\\nincome items that were directly recognised in the statement  of comprehensive income.  \\\\n-  The income tax is recognised on the basis of the net taxable income using the effective tax rate \\\\nat the financial position date in addition to previous year’s  tax adjustments.  \\\\n- Deferred tax arising from temporary time differences  between the carrying amount of assets and \\\\nliabilities are recognised in accordance with the accounting bases and the value based on the tax \\\\nbases. Deferred tax is determined based on the method used to realise or settle the current values \\\\nof these assets and liabilities using the tax rates prevailing at the financial position date.  \\\\n- The deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be \\\\nrealised in the future whereby the asset can be utilised. The value of deferred  tax assets will be \\\\nreduced by the value of the portion not yielding the expected tax benefit during the following \\\\nyears. However, in case the expected tax benefit increases, the deferred tax assets will increase to \\\\nthe extent of previous reduction.   \\\\n \\\\nZ) Capital issuance fees  \\\\n-  Issued and paid up -capital (i.e. Bank\\\\'s own equity instruments) is initially measured at the \\\\ncash proceeds received, less transaction costs directly  attributable to the issuance of new \\\\nshares, issuance of shares to effect business combinat ion, or issue of share options. \\\\nTransaction costs, net of tax  benefits, are reported as a deduction from equity.  \\\\n \\\\nAA) Dividends  \\\\n- Dividends on equity instruments issued by the bank are recognized when the general \\\\nassembly of the bank’s shareholders a pproves them. Dividends include the employees’ \\\\nprofit share and the board of directors’ remuneration as prescribed by the bank\\\\'s articles of \\\\nincorporation and the corporate law.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 34 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n34 \\\\n 4-Financial risk management  \\\\n- ADIB, as a result of the activities it exercises, is exposed to various financial risks, taking into \\\\naccount that risks are the basis of the financial activity, and some risks or group of risks are \\\\nanalysed, evaluated and managed altogether. ADIB intends t o strike a balance between the risk \\\\nand return and to reduce the probable adverse effects on ADIB’s financial performance. The most \\\\nimportant types of risks are credit risk and market risk. Market risk comprises foreign currency \\\\nexchange rates, Profit  rate risk and other pricing risks.  \\\\n- The risk management policies have been laid down to determine and analyse the risks, set limits \\\\nto the risks and control them through reliable methods and up -to-date IT systems.  ADIB regularly \\\\nreviews the risk management pol icies and systems and amends them to reflect the changes in the \\\\nmarkets, products and services, and the best updated applications.  \\\\n- Risks are managed by both the Risk Committee and the Market Risk and Credit Risk Departments \\\\nin view of the policies approved  by the Board of Directors.  The Risk Departments determine, \\\\nevaluate and cover the financial risks, in collaboration with ADIB’s various operating units, and \\\\nthe Board provides written principles to manage risks as a whole, in addition to written policies  \\\\ncovering specific risk areas like credit risk, foreign exchange rate risk, Profit  rate risk and using \\\\nderivative and non -derivative financial instruments. Moreover, the Risk Committee is \\\\nindependently responsible for periodic review of risk management and  control environment.  \\\\n \\\\nRisk Management Strategy  \\\\nADIB practises its activities through business lines that generate many risks that may vary in terms \\\\nof frequency, strength and fluctuation. Therefore, ADIB has taken measures to ensure the effective \\\\nmanagement of these risks, including increasing the ability to standardize the degree of risks appetite \\\\nand risk identifiers, to develop the terms of reference of the core risk department, and to implement \\\\nan efficient and high -quality risk department stru cture.  The main objectives of ADIB\\\\'s risk \\\\ndepartment framework are as follows:  \\\\n- Contributing to the development of ADIB\\\\'s various lines of business to reach an optimum level of general \\\\nrisk. \\\\n- Ensuring the continuity of ADIB through the implementation of a h igh quality risk department \\\\ninfrastructure.  \\\\n- In determining ADIB\\\\'s overall risk appetite, ADIB\\\\'s management has taken into account various \\\\nconsiderations and variables, including:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The relative balance between risk and proceeds for ADIB\\\\'s various activities . \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The degree of the sensitivity of profits to business cycles and credit and economic cycles.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Achieving a parallel package of good profits flows   \\\\n \\\\nRisk Management Governance and Risk Management Principles  \\\\nADIB\\\\'s risk department governance is based on the following:  \\\\n \\\\n1- Strong management intervention at all levels of the organization, starting from the Board of \\\\nDirectors to the management of field task forces responsible for operations.  \\\\n2- An integrated framework for internal procedures and guidelines.  \\\\n3- Continuous  monitoring by business lines and supporting functions, as well as, by an independent \\\\nRisk Control Body and compliance with the rules and procedures.  \\\\nRisk and audit committees within the Board are more specifically responsible for examining the \\\\ncompatibili ty of the internal framework in order to monitor risks and the adherence to the rules.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 35 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n35 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n \\\\nRisk Categories:  \\\\n \\\\nThe risks associated with ADIB\\\\'s banking activities include  the following:  \\\\n4/1 Credit risk  \\\\n- Credit risk represents potential losses arising from the possibility that the borrowers or \\\\ncounterparties will fail to fulfil  their obligations in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk \\\\narises mainly from due from banks balances, financing and faci lities to banks, individuals, SMEs \\\\nand micro -enterprises, institutions and associations related to such activities. Credit risk may also \\\\narise from supporting financing / credit guarantees granted such as credit options (Credit Default \\\\nSwap), financial gua rantee contracts, letters of credit and letters of guarantee.  \\\\n- ADIB is also exposed to credit risk from investment activities in debt instruments and positions \\\\noutstanding from trading and financial derivative activities.  \\\\n- Credit risk is the most important r isk to ADIB\\\\'s activity and therefore ADIB manages the credit \\\\nrisk exposures carefully. Management and control of ADIB\\\\'s credit risk shall focus on the retail \\\\nbanking credit risk management group and the institutions at the Risk Department, which reports \\\\nto the Risk Committee, Senior Management, Heads of Operation Department and BOD on interim \\\\nbasis.  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/1 Credit risk measurement  \\\\nFinancing and facilities to banks and customers (incl uding commitments and financial \\\\nguarantees)  \\\\nThe estimated exposure to credit  risk for purpose of credit risk management is complex, requiring the \\\\nuse of statistical and electronic models, as credit risk exposure varies with changes in market \\\\nconditions and other economic aspects in a complex and rapid manner. Exposure of credit ri sk \\\\nchanges with changes in the level, value, time of expected cash flows and over time. The credit risk \\\\nassessment of the asset portfolio, therefore, requires further estimates of the probability of default and \\\\nrelated loss rates. ADIB measures the credit risk losses using the rates of probability of failure (failure \\\\nto fulfil contractual obligations) (Probability of default) on the basis of the book balance of the \\\\nfinancial instrument at the date of failure (Exposure at default), and the rate of loss upon failure (Loss \\\\ngiven default).  \\\\n \\\\nADIB\\\\'s internal rating categories  \\\\n \\\\nClassification                Classification rating  \\\\n \\\\nStage (I)           Good Debts  \\\\nStage (II)                      Special Follow -up \\\\nStage (III)                      Bad Debts  \\\\n--- Page 36 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n36 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nClassification of the Credit Risks  \\\\nADIB assesses the probability of default on each customer / affiliated group / credit product, using \\\\nmethods to classify customers in different categories, ta king into account the minimum rating in \\\\naccordance with the CBE\\\\'s instructions on determining the creditworthiness of customers and the \\\\nformation of provisions issued during 2005. Accordingly, ADIB uses a group of models and methods \\\\nthat are internally des igned models and valuation methods for the counterparty categories and \\\\ncustomers and the nature of the various financings under the available information collected at the \\\\ndate of application of the used model (e.g. income level, spendable income level, gua rantees for \\\\nindividual customers, revenue, industry type, and other financial and non -financial indicators for \\\\ninstitutions). ADIB completes these indicators with a range of external data such as query reports \\\\nfrom CBE, credit reporting companies on borrow ers and reports of other domestic and foreign credit \\\\nrating agencies. In addition, the models used by ADIB shall allow the systematic assessment of \\\\nexperts by credit risk officers in the final internal credit rating. Thus, this allows to take into account \\\\nother matters and indicators that may not have been taken as part of other data inputs into evaluation \\\\nforms and methods designed internally or through external sources.  \\\\nCredit scores are calibrated so that the risk of failure increases incrementally with each higher risk \\\\nscore. This means that the difference in failure rates of grade A and A - is less than the difference in \\\\nfailure rates between grade B and B -. The following are additional considerations for each type of \\\\ncredit portfolios held by ADIB:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Individuals, Retail Banking Products and Small and Micro Enterprises  \\\\nAfter the date of initial recognition, the payment behaviour  of the borrower shall be monitored on \\\\nan interim basis to calculate a payment pattern. Any other known information about the borrower \\\\nidentified by ADIB may affect the creditworthiness such as unemployment rates and non -payment \\\\nprecedents as they will be included to measure the repayment pattern, and accordingly, default \\\\nrates will be determined for each scale of repayment pattern.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Large and Medium Enterprises   \\\\nThe rating is determined at the level of the  borrower / groups with similar credit risk, and any  \\\\nupdated or new credit information or assessments will be  included in the credit system on a \\\\ncontinuous and periodic basis. In addition, information on the creditworthiness of the borrower / \\\\ngroups with similar credit risk are periodically updated from oth er sources such as financial \\\\nstatements and other published financial and non -financial data. This will determine the degree of \\\\ninternal credit rating updated and failure rates.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Debt Instruments issued by the Egyptian Government and CBE  \\\\nDebt instruments, Treasury Bills and Government Bonds  \\\\n- ADIB uses external classifications of institutions that comply with the CBE\\\\'s instructions to manage \\\\nthe credit risk for debt instruments in the investment portfolio. These ratings are regularly monitored \\\\nand updated per iodically. The default rates associated with each rating are determined on the basis \\\\nof rates achieved over the previous 12 months as published by the aforementioned rating agencies. \\\\nThe loss rate for government debt instruments and the central bank in loc al currency equals zero.  \\\\n- ADIB\\\\'s rating of creditworthiness of government debt instruments, where the primary measure of \\\\neach rating category gives a specific range of probability of default, is stable over time. ADIB \\\\ncomplies with the internal rating categ ories alongside with the rating categories set by CBE \\\\naccording to the instructions of determining creditworthiness and the formation of provisions, and \\\\nreviewing that compliance on a regular basis. The rating methods are periodically re -calibrated and \\\\nvalidated to reflect the most recent projections in light of all assumptions observed in reality.  \\\\n--- Page 37 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n37 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/2 Future Data Used in the Expected Loss Model.  \\\\n- Future data is used to determine whether there is a significant increase in the credit risk of financial \\\\ninstruments and the estimated credit losses (ECL). ADIB management determines the key \\\\neconomic variables that affect the credit risk and credit losses expected for each credit portfolio by \\\\nanalysing  historical data. The economic variables and their impact are different on both Probability \\\\nof Default (PD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) depending on the \\\\ndifferent financial asset . ADIB seeks expert opinions regarding such assumptions and estimations, \\\\nif necessary.  \\\\n- Risk departments and credit departments of ADIB make estimates of these economic variables on \\\\na quarterly basis, and identify better estimations for those variables over  the next five years. After \\\\nthese five years, ADIB uses method of \\\"Mean Reversion Approach\\\" in estimating those variables \\\\nover the remaining life of each financial asset. Consequently, in the long term, those economic \\\\nvariables head to the level of the cur rently estimated averages or the estimated growth averages in \\\\nthe current period within a period of 2 -5 years.  \\\\n- In order to determine the impact of these economic variables on PD \\\"Probability of Default\\\", \\\\n\\\"Exposure at Default\\\" EAD and \\\"Loss Given Default\\\" LGD, ADIB\\\\'s management conducts the \\\\n\\\"Regression Analysis\\\" in order to understand the historical effects resulting from those variables \\\\non the default rates and the inputs used in calculating EAD and LGD.  \\\\n- In addition to basic economic scenarios, ADIB\\\\'s mana gement makes other possible scenarios, as \\\\nwell as the perceptions related to each scenario separately.  \\\\n- ADIB\\\\'s management conducts these economic scenarios for all important credit products in order \\\\nto ensure that all non - linarites variables are included.  These scenarios and their related \\\\ncharacteristics are reviewed at the financial position date.  \\\\n- Lifetime PD is used for both basic and other scenarios where the outcome of multiplying each \\\\nscenario is made with their respective probabilities, as well as th e supporting indicators and \\\\nqualitative indicators. Based on the results of this study, an estimate is made as to whether that \\\\nfinancial asset is at the first, second or third stage, on the basis of which it is determined whether \\\\nthe expected credit loss ( ECL) is calculated on a 12 -month basis or over the lifetime of the financial \\\\ninstrument \\\"Lifetime ECL\\\".  \\\\n- Expectations and probability of occurrence ate subject to highly uncertain degree as known for any \\\\neconomic expectations, so actual results may differ significantly from those expected. ADIB \\\\nconducts the best estimate of these potential projections and makes an analytical study of the \\\\nunrelated and non -similar factors for the various credit portfolios in order to arrive at appropriate \\\\nscenarios for all p ossible scenarios.  \\\\n--- Page 38 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n38 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nVariable Economic Assumptions  \\\\nThe following are the key year -end assumptions that have been used  to estimate ECL 31 December \\\\n2023. \\\\nEnterprises\\\\' Portfolio  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Gross domestic product (GDP).  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Stock Exchange Market Index  \\\\nIndividuals\\\\' Portfolio  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Gross domestic product (GDP).  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Private consumption  \\\\n- Balancing capital expenditures as a percentage of GDP.  \\\\nThe basic, downside, and upside scenarios were used for all portfolios.  \\\\nADIB did not use some future data other than the aforementioned, such as the impact of any \\\\nregulatory, legislative or political changes, due to not being considered to have a significant impact, \\\\nand therefore no adjustment was made to the ECL for these variables, w hich was reviewed and \\\\nmonitored to ensure their suitability on a quarterly basis.  \\\\nSensitivity Analysis  \\\\nThe main assumptions affecting the expected credit loss provision (ECL) are as follows  \\\\nIndividuals and Institutions Portfolio  \\\\nThe following represent the  most important sensitivity analysis used to estimate the expected credit \\\\nlosses as at 31 December 2023:  \\\\n- At least three scenarios are conducted to study future forecasts and to determine their impact on the \\\\nvariables of the expected credit loss measurem ent model. These scenarios represent:  \\\\n- Basic Scenario  \\\\n- Downside Scenario  \\\\n- Upside Scenario  \\\\n- The calculation of the expected credit loss reflects , without any bias, the probable weighted scenario, \\\\nwhich is determined based on the assessment of a range of expected results instead of reliance on \\\\nthe upside and downside scenarios.  \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 39 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n39 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nClassification of loss -related instruments measured on the basis of similar groups  \\\\nRegarding Expected Credit Losses “ECL”, groups are classified on the basis of similar credit risk \\\\ncharacteristics, so that risk at ADIB is homogenous.

These \\\\nrestructuring activities include arrangements to extend the repayment peri od, grace periods, \\\\nexemption from payment or some/or of the Profit s. Restructuring policies and practices are based \\\\non indicators or criteria that indicate - in management\\\\'s assessment - that payment will likely \\\\ncontinue. These policies remain under consta nt review.  \\\\n- ADIB continues to monitor whether there is a significant increase in credit risk with respect to those \\\\nassets through the use of specific models for the adjusted assets.  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/4  Risk limit control and mitigation policies  \\\\nADIB manages, limits and  controls concentrations of credit risk at the level of debtor, groups, \\\\nindustries and countries.  \\\\nADIB manages the credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk that will be \\\\naccepted at the level of each borrower or groups of borrowers and at the level of economic activities \\\\nand geographical sectors. Such risks are monitored on an ongoing basis and are subject to an annual \\\\nor frequent review when necessary. Limits at the level of borrower/ bank, product, sector and country \\\\nare approved q uarterly by the Board of Directors.  \\\\nThe exposure to any borrower including banks is further restricted by sub -limits covering on - and \\\\noff-the financial position exposures, and daily delivery risk limits in relation to trading items such as \\\\nforward Islamic foreign exchange contracts.  Actual exposures against limits are monitored daily.  \\\\nExposure to credit risk is also managed through regular analysis of the existing and potential \\\\nborrowers\\\\' ability to meet their obligations and through adjusting the financin g limits as appropriate.  \\\\nHere are some ways to limit risk:  \\\\nGuarantees  \\\\nADIB applies a range of policies controls to mitigate credit risk. One of these methods is obtaining \\\\nguarantees against the financed funds. ADIB establishes guidelines for specific categ ories of \\\\nacceptable guarantees.   \\\\nThe principal guarantees types for financing and facilities are:  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Cash and cash equivalents  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Real estate mortgages.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Commercial mortgages  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Financial instruments mortgage, such as debt and equity instruments.  \\\\nLong -term financing and corporate lending are often secured, while credit facilities for individuals \\\\nare unsecured. To reduce credit loss to a minimum, ADIB seeks additional guarantees from the \\\\nconcerned parties as soon as impairment indicators are noticed for any f inancing or facilities.  \\\\nADIB determines the collaterals held to guarantee assets other than financing and facilities according \\\\nto the nature of the instrument. Generally, debt instruments and treasury bills are unsecured except \\\\nfor asset -backed securities and similar instruments that are secured by a financial instruments \\\\nportfolio.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 41 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n41 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nCredit -related commitments  \\\\nCredit -related commitments represent the unused portion of credit limit authorised to grant financing, \\\\nguarantees or letters of credit.  ADIB is exposed to a possible loss of an amount that equals the total \\\\nunused commitments as for the credit risk resulting from credit -related commitments.  However, the \\\\nprobable amount of loss is less than the unused commi tments as most commitments related to \\\\ngranting credit represent contingent liabilities to customers maintaining certain credit standards. \\\\nADIB monitors the maturity date of the credit commitments because long -term commitments are of \\\\na higher credit risk th an short -term commitments.  \\\\n4/1/5  Impairment and provisioning policies  \\\\nThe aforementioned internal rating systems focus more on credit quality planning as of the date \\\\nfinancing  and investment activities are recognized. Otherwise, impairment losses that occur at the \\\\nfinancial statements date are only recognised for financial reports purposes based on objective \\\\nevidence indicating impairment according to what will be mentioned in this note. Due to the different \\\\nmethodologies applied, the amounts of incurred credit losses charged to the financial statements are \\\\nusually lower than the estimated loss amount using the expected loss model used for purposes of the \\\\nrules the Central Bank of Egypt.  \\\\nThe impairment loss provision included in the financial statements at the end of the year is derived \\\\nfrom the four internal ratings. However, the majority of the provision is derived from the last rating. \\\\nThe following table shows the percentage of the items within the financial statements for the period \\\\nended 31 December 2023  related to financing, facilities, and related impairment for each of ADIB\\\\'s \\\\ninternal assessment categories:  \\\\n \\\\nThe internal rating tools assist the management to determine whether there is evidence of impairment \\\\nunder EAS 47, based on the following criteria set out by ADIB:  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Significant financial difficulty of the customer or the debtor.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Breach of the financing agr eement conditions such as default.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Expected bankruptcy of the customer, entering into a liquidation lawsuit, or restructuring the \\\\nfinance granted to the customer.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Deterioration of the competitive position of the customer.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Granting privileges or assignments  by ADIB to the customer due to economic or legal reasons \\\\nrelated to the financial difficulties of the borrower, which are not granted by ADIB in the normal \\\\ncourse of business.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Impairment of the guarantee.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Deterioration of creditworthiness.  \\\\n--- Page 42 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n42 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n4/1/6 Impairment and provisions policies - continued  \\\\nADIB’s policies require reviewing all financial assets that exceed specific materiality at least once a \\\\nyear or more, when required. The impairment loss is determined for accounts evaluated on an \\\\nindividual basis by determining case -by-case actual losses at the financial statements date. These \\\\npolicies are applied on all accounts which have specific materiality on an individual basis. The \\\\nvaluation usually includes the exis ting guarantee, the related enforcements on these guarantees and \\\\nthe expected collections from those accounts.  \\\\nA provision is made for impairment losses on the basis of the group of similar assets using the \\\\navailable historical experience, personal judgmen t and statistical techniques.  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/7 General banking risk measurement model  \\\\n \\\\nIn addition to ADIB\\\\'s four internal rating categories described above, the management classifies loans \\\\nand facilities in the form of more detailed sub -groups in line with the req uirements of the Central \\\\nBank of Egypt. The assets exposed to credit risk in these groups are classified according to detailed \\\\nrules and conditions that rely heavily on information related to customer\\\\'s business, financial position \\\\nand regularity of paymen t. \\\\nADIB calculates the provisions required to offset the impairment of assets exposed to credit risk, \\\\nincluding credit -related commitments, on the basis of ratios set by the Central Bank of Egypt. In case \\\\nof the excess of the provision for impairment losse s required in accordance with the creditworthiness \\\\nrules of the Central Bank of Egypt over the provision required to use the expected credit losses, such \\\\nexcess in  the provision is set aside as a general banking risk reserve within equity to be deducted \\\\nagainst retained earnings by the amount of that excess.  \\\\nThe following is a description of the creditworthiness categories of the institutions according to the \\\\nprinciples for determining the creditworthiness of customers in accordance with the instructions o f \\\\nthe Central Bank of Egypt in this regard and the percentage of provisions required for the impairment \\\\nof assets exposed to credit risk:  \\\\nCBE rating  Rating  \\\\ndescription  Required \\\\nprovision %  Internal \\\\nrating  Internal rating \\\\ndescription  \\\\n1 Low risk  Zero  1 Good  debts  \\\\n2 Moderate risk  1% 1 Good debts  \\\\n3 Satisfactory risk  1% 1 Good debts  \\\\n4 Appropriate risk  2% 1 Good debts  \\\\n5 Acceptable risk  2% 1 Good debts  \\\\n6 Marginally \\\\nacceptable risk  3% 1 Regular watch up  \\\\n7 Risk needs special \\\\nattention  5% 2 Special watch up  \\\\n8 Substandard  20% 3 Non-performing \\\\ndebts  \\\\n9 Doubtful  50% 3 Non-performing \\\\ndebts  \\\\n10 \\\\n Bad debts  100%  3 Non-performing \\\\ndebts  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 43 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n43 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n4/1/8 Maximum limit for credit risk before guarantees  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02d The previous table represents the maximum exposure on 31 December 2023, without taking any \\\\nguarantees into consideration.

The market risk arises from the open positions of the Profit  rate and the currency, \\\\nas each is exposed to general and priva te movements in the market and changes in the level of sensitivity \\\\nto market rates or prices such as rates of Profit  and exchange rates. ADIB separates its exposure to market \\\\nrisk to trading or non -trading portfolios.  \\\\nThe management of market risk arising from trading or non -trading activities is concentrated in ADIB\\\\'s \\\\nrisk management and is monitored by two separate teams. Market risk reports are reported to the Risk \\\\nCommittee of the Board of Directors and heads of operating units on a regular basis.  \\\\nThe p ortfolios of financial investments at fair value through profit or loss include those positions resulting \\\\nfrom ADIB\\\\'s direct dealing with customers or with the market, while non -trading portfolios arise primarily \\\\nfrom managing the Profit  rate on assets and  liabilities. These portfolios include foreign exchange risk and \\\\nequity instruments arising from financial investments at amortized cost and financial investments at fair \\\\nvalue through other comprehensive income.  \\\\n \\\\n4/2/1 Market risk measurement techniques  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 As part of market risk management, ADIB undertakes various hedging strategies. ADIB also enters \\\\ninto swaps to match the Profit  rate risk associated with the debt instruments and fixed -rate long -term \\\\nfinancing if the fair value option has been applied. The m ajor measurement techniques used to control \\\\nmarket risk are outlined below:  \\\\n \\\\n Value at risk  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 ADIB applies a ‘value at risk’ methodology (VAR) for trading and non -trading portfolios to estimate \\\\nthe market risk on positions held and the maximum expected losses based on a number of assumptions \\\\nfor various changes in market conditions.  The Board sets  separate limits for the value of risk that may \\\\nbe accepted by ADIB for trading and non -trading portfolios and are monitored daily by ADIB’s market \\\\nrisk management.   \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 VAR is a statistical estimation of the expected losses on the current portfolio resulting  from adverse \\\\nmarket movements, which represent the maximum amount ADIB expects to lose using a confidence \\\\nlevel of (98%).  Therefore, there is a statistical probability of (2%) that actual losses could be greater \\\\nthan the VAR estimation.  The VAR model as sumes that the holding period is ten days before closing \\\\nthe open positions. It is also assumed that the market movement during the holding period will follow \\\\nthe same pattern of movement that occurred during the previous ten days. ADIB estimates the previ ous \\\\nmovement based on data for the previous five years. ADIB applies these historical changes in rates, \\\\nprices, indicators, etc., directly to its current positions. This approach is called historical simulation. \\\\nActual outcomes are monitored regularly to t est the validity of the assumptions and factors used in the \\\\nVAR calculation.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 The use of that technique does not prevent the loss to exceed those limits in the case of a larger \\\\nmovement in the market.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 As VAR is considered a primary part of ADIB’s market ris k control technique, VAR limits are \\\\nestablished by the Assets and Liabilities Committee regularly for all trading and non -trading \\\\ntransactions and allocated to business units. Actual VAR are compared to the limits set by ADIB and \\\\nreviewed daily by ADIB’s r isk management. The quality of the VAR model is continuously monitored \\\\nthrough enhanced VAR testing of the trading portfolio and the results of the tests are submitted to the \\\\nAssets and Liabilities Committee.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 The quality of VAR model is monitored on an ongoing basis by reinforced tests to the results of the \\\\nVAR of trading portfolio, and the results of tests are reported to the senior management and Board of \\\\nDirectors.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 53 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n53 \\\\n \\\\nFinancial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n \\\\nStress testing  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Stress testing provides an indicator of the expected losses that may arise from sharp adverse \\\\ncircumstances. Stress testing is designed to match the business using standard analysis for specific \\\\nscenarios. The stress testing carried out by the risk management include risk factor str ess testing where \\\\nsharp movements are applied to each risk category and emerging markets stress tests, as emerging \\\\nmarkets are subject to sharp movements and special stress tests, including possible stress events \\\\naffecting specific positions or regions, su ch as what may arise in a certain region due to applying a \\\\nfree rate on a certain currency. The results of the stress testing are reviewed by the top management \\\\nand the Board of Directors.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Stress testing related to exchange rate  \\\\nThe following table shows the position of the currencies (surplus or deficit) of the items inside and \\\\noutside the balance sheet  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n4/2/2 VAR summary  \\\\nTotal value at risk by the type of risk  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 54 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n54 \\\\n \\\\nFinancial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n4/2/3  Risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 ADIB is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows.

Fair value Profit  rate risk is the risk that  \\\\nthe value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market Profit  rates. The Profit  \\\\nmargin may increase due to these changes; however, profits may decrease in case unexpected \\\\nmovements arise. The ALCO Committee sets limits on the leve l of mismatch of Profit  rate repricing that \\\\nADIB may maintain, which is monitored daily by ADIB’s risk management.  \\\\n \\\\nProfit  rate structure risk management system  \\\\nRisk assessment, limits and corrective procedures are undertaken by the Asset -Liability Committee \\\\n(ALCO) under the chairmanship of the President of ADIB, the membership of the Executive Directors, \\\\nthe CFO, Directors of Commercial Departments, the Branch Ne twork Manager, the Secretary General \\\\nand the President of the International Transaction Chamber.

It \\\\nstarts with a discussion on the concept and importance of corporate governance, followed \\\\nby a review of the various as pects of the capital market, in cluding the structure of the \\\\nstock market, the legal and supervisory fr amework, registration requirements, and the \\\\nownership structure. The paper then assesses Egypt’s corporate governance standards in \\\\naccordance with the five OECD principles, namely, shareholders’ rights, equitable \\\\ntreatment of shareholders, stakeholders’ role  in corporate governance, disclosure and \\\\ntransparency, and responsibilities of the board of directors. \\\\nThe analysis shows that corporate gove rnance standards in Egypt have improved \\\\nsignificantly, as reflected in the overall asse ssment of all five OECD principles. The \\\\ndegree of progress, however, varies from one principle to another. Finally, the paper points out that Egyptian companies are stil l far from properly implementing corporate \\\\ngovernance principles.  \\\\n \\\\nﻤﻠﺨﺹ \\\\nﻤﺼﺭ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ ﻟﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﻨﻅﻤﺔ  ﻭﺍﻟﻤﻌﺎﻴﻴﺭ  ﻭﺍﻟﻘﻭﺍﻨﻴﻥ  ﺍﻟﻘﻭﺍﻋﺩ ﺘﻘﻴﻴﻡ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﻫﺫﻩ ﺘﻬﺩﻑ .  ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﻭﺘﺒﺩﺃ\\\\n ﻫﻴﻜل ﺤﻴﺙ ﻤﻥ ﺍﻟﻤﺎل، ﻟﺴﻭﻕ ﺍﻟﻤﺨﺘﻠﻔﺔ  ﺍﻟﺠﻭﺍﻨﺏ ﺘﺘﻨﺎﻭل ﺜﻡ ﻭﺃﻫﻤﻴﺘﻪ،  ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﻤﻔﻬﻭﻡ ﺒﻤﻨﺎﻗﺸﺔ\\\\nﺍﻟﻤﺎﻟﻴﺔ، ﺍﻷﻭﺭﺍﻕ  ﺴﻭﻕ ﻴﺤﻜﻡ ﺍﻟﺫﻱ ﻭﺍﻟﺭﻗﺎﺒﻲ  ﺍﻟﻘﺎﻨﻭﻨﻲ  ﻭﺍﻹﻁﺎﺭ  ﺍﻟﺒﻭﺭﺼﺔ،   ﻓﻲ ﻭﺍﻟﻘﻴﺩ ﺍﻟﺘﺴﺠﻴل  ﻭﻤﺘﻁﻠﺒﺎﺕ\\\\nﺍﻟﻤﺎﻟﻴﺔ ﺍﻷﻭﺭﺍﻕ  ﻤﻠﻜﻴﺔ ﻭﻫﻴﻜل ﺍﻟﺒﻭﺭﺼﺔ،  ﺠﺩﺍﻭل .  ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ  ﻗﻭﺍﻋﺩ ﺘﻁﻭﺭ ﺘﻘﻴﻴﻡ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺫﻟﻙ ﺒﻌﺩ ﺘﻨﺘﻘل ﺜﻡ\\\\n ﻋﺎﻡ ﻭﺍﻟﺘﻨﻤﻴﺔ ﺍﻻﻗﺘﺼﺎﺩﻱ  ﺍﻟﺘﻌﺎﻭﻥ ﻤﻨﻅﻤﺔ ﻭﻀﻌﺘﻬﺎ  ﺍﻟﺘﻲ ﺍﻟﺨﻤﺱ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﻟﻤﻌﺎﻴﻴﺭ ﻭﻓﻘﺎ ﻤﺼﺭ\\\\nﻭﻫﻲ٩٩٩١ ،:  ﻟﻠﻤ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺴﺎﻭﻴﺔ  ﺍﻟﻤﻌﺎﻤﻠﺔ  ﺍﻟﻤﺴﺎﻫﻤﻴﻥ،  ﺤﻘﻭﻕ  ﺍﻷﻁﺭﺍﻑ  ﺃﻭ ﺍﻟﻤﺼﺎﻟﺢ  ﺃﺼﺤﺎﺏ  ﺩﻭﺭ ﺴﺎﻫﻤﻴﻥ،\\\\nﺍﻹﺩﺍﺭﺓ ﻤﺠﻠﺱ ﻭﻤﺴﺅﻭﻟﻴﺎﺕ  ﻭﺍﻟﺸﻔﺎﻓﻴﺔ،  ﺍﻹﻓﺼﺎﺡ  ﺒﺎﻟﺸﺭﻜﺔ،  ﺍﻟﻤﺭﺘﺒﻁﺔ.   \\\\n ﻗﻭﺍﻋﺩ ﺇﺭﺴﺎﺀ ﻤﺠﺎل ﻓﻲ ﻤﻠﺤﻭﻅﺎ ﺘﻁﻭﺭﺍ ﺸﻬﺩ ﻗﺩ ﻤﺼﺭ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﺎل ﺴﻭﻕ ﺃﻥ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﺨﻠﺼﺕ ﻭﻗﺩ\\\\nﺍﻟﺨﻤﺱ ﻟﻠﻤﻌﺎﻴﻴﺭ  ﺍﻹﺠﻤﺎﻟﻲ  ﺍﻟﺘﻘﻴﻴﻡ ﻓﻲ ﺘﺤﺴﻥ ﻋﺎﻡ ﺒﺸﻜل ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﺘﺭﺘﺏ ﻤﻤﺎ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ، ﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ  ،ﻟﻠﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ  ﻭﺇﻥ\\\\nﻵﺨﺭ ﻤﻌﻴﺎﺭ ﻤﻥ ﺍﺨﺘﻠﻔﺕ ﻗﺩ ﺍﻟﺘﺤﺴﻥ ﺩﺭﺠﺔ ﻜﺎﻨﺕ.  ﺃﻭﻀﺤ ﻜﻤﺎ  ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﺃﻨﺕ  ﺃﻴﻀﺎ  ﺘﺤﺴﻥ ﻤﻥ ﺍﻟﺭﻏﻡ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻪ\\\\n ﺇﻟﻰ ﻤﺎﺯﺍﻟﺕ ﻟﻠﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﺍﻟﻌﻤﻠﻴﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﻤﺎﺭﺴﺎﺕ ﺃﻥ ﺇﻻ ﻤﺼﺭ، ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﻟﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﻭﺍﻟﻤﺅﺴﺴﻲ  ﺍﻟﻘﺎﻨﻭﻨﻲ ﺍﻹﻁﺎﺭ\\\\nﺍﻟﻤﻭﻀﻭﻋﺔ  ﻟﻠﻤﺒﺎﺩﺉ ﺍﻟﺴﻠﻴﻡ ﺍﻟﺘﻁﺒﻴﻕ ﻋﻥ ﺒﻌﻴﺩﺓ ﻜﺒﻴﺭ ﺤﺩ. \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 3 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nTable of Contents \\\\n \\\\nHighlights  \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction: The Concept of Corporate Governance and Its Importance \\\\n \\\\nPreliminary Section: Comprehensive Vi ew of the Capital Market in Egypt \\\\n  Stock Market Structure  \\\\n  Legal and Supervisory Framework \\\\nRegistration and Listing Requirements Ownership Structure \\\\nPart 1:  Shareholders’ Rights \\\\n1/1  Fundamental Rights \\\\n1/2   The General Assembly Meetings and Disclosure of Financial Statements  \\\\nPart 2: Equitable Treatment of Shareholders \\\\n2/1  Voting Rights  \\\\n2/2  Participation in the Company’s Fundamental Decisions \\\\n2/3  Follow-Up and Supervision of Companies \\\\n2/4  Insider Trading and Self-Dealing \\\\n2/5  Deals with Related Parties \\\\nPart 3: Stakeholders’ Role  in Corporate Governance \\\\n3/1  Report of Legal Rights  \\\\n3/2  Compensation for Rights Violation \\\\n3/3  Mechanisms to Promote Stakeholders’ Participation  \\\\n3/4  Access to Information \\\\nPart 4: Disclosure  and Transparency \\\\n4/1  Disclosure of Important Information \\\\n4/2  The Auditor 4/3  Disclosing Ownership of  the Majority of Shares \\\\n4/4  Disclosure for Board Members and Executive Directors \\\\n4/5  Disclosure of Other Information \\\\nPart 5: Responsibilities of the Board of Directors \\\\n5/1  Structure and Legal Responsibilities \\\\n5/2  Selection of Board Members \\\\n5/3  Main Responsibilities \\\\n5/4  Independent Supervision \\\\nConclusion: Main Results and Recommendations \\\\nAnnexes  \\\\nReferences\\\\n \\\\n--- Page 4 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nHighlights \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Corporate governance refers to the rules,  laws and standard s that define the \\\\nrelationship between the company’s ma nagement and its shareholders and \\\\nstakeholders or related parties, name ly the bondholders, workers, suppliers, \\\\ncreditors and consumers. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 This report – which was conducted by th e Egyptian Center for Economic Studies \\\\nin cooperation with the Ministry of Fore ign Trade, the Capital Market Authority \\\\nand the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Excha nges – aims to evaluate the laws and \\\\nrules that ensure the proper applicat ion of corporate governance in Egypt. The \\\\nevaluation was based on the institutiona l development of corporate governance \\\\nstandards in Egypt in comparison with th e five OECD principles issued by the \\\\nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development in 1999. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Review of the laws governing the capital market in E gypt showed that the legal \\\\nframework that regulates corporate govern ance rules and principles in Egypt is \\\\nbased on the French civil law of companies.  There is no direct effect of Islamic \\\\nShari’a (legislation) on such rules. On  the other hand, the Anglo-American law \\\\naffects the central depository and registry law and the draft capital market law, \\\\nwhich is due to be referred to the People’s Assembly (Parliament) for discussion. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Capital Market Authority (CMA) is the main party responsible for capital \\\\nmarket regulation and supervision with the help of the Cairo and Alexandria \\\\nStock Exchanges (CASE) and the Egyp tian Clearance and Central Depositing \\\\nCompany. Other non-profit or self-regulator y institutions play supporting roles in \\\\nthis respect. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 In Egypt, there is one stock market with  two premises for trading: Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria, which include four listing tables. The number of listed companies \\\\nrose from 656 in 1992 to 1,151 in December 2002. The market value rose from 8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP ) in 1992 to 32 percent in 2002. Trading \\\\nvalue/market capital rose from 3.4 pe rcent in 1992 to 21 percent in 2002.  \\\\n1 \\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Developments in the Capital Market and the Cairo and Alexandria Stock \\\\nExchanges indicate that the peri od from September 2001 to March 2003 \\\\nwitnessed considerable improvement in instituting corporate governance rules in \\\\nEgypt. This resulted in a general improve ment in the overall assessment of these \\\\nrules. The evaluation showed improvement in the five principles of corporate \\\\ngovernance, with varying degrees of improve ment from one principle to another. \\\\nAccording to the assessment, the five principles of corporate governance in Egypt \\\\nmay be classified in descending order ba sed on their degree of conformity with \\\\nthe international principles as follows: st akeholders’ role in corporate governance, \\\\nequitable treatment of shareholders, shareholder\\\\'s rights, disclosure and \\\\ntransparency, and responsibilities of the board  of director. It is possible to refer to \\\\nsome procedures that led to such an overall improvement in the assessment, including the issuance of new rules for listing and disclosure that are in harmony \\\\nwith the international principles, which ar e related to the comp any’s profitability, \\\\nnumber of shareholders and minimum limit of share capital. The rules of \\\\ndisclosure were also developed and co mpanies were obliged to form auditing \\\\ncommittees and to appoint an officer respons ible for relations with investors. The \\\\nprocedures also include the establis hment of a settlements guarantee fund, \\\\nallowing the registered owner to vote on be half of the beneficiary owner and per \\\\nthe former\\\\'s instructions, and allowing  voting through ordina ry and electronic \\\\nmail. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The report concluded that there are certa in rules that need more improvement \\\\nsuch as protecting minority shareholders’ ri ghts, providing strict control to ensure \\\\nthat the board of directors performs  its responsibilities, emphasizing the \\\\nimportance of disclosure in all the detail s of the ownership st ructure, as well as \\\\ncompleting the legal framework and strengthening the supervisory institutions’ \\\\ncapacities. The report also showed that there is still a need for improving the application of these standard s among Egyptian companies.  \\\\n2 \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nIntroduction: The Concept of Corporate Governance and Its Importance  \\\\nGenerally speaking, the concept of corporate governance refers  to the rules, laws and \\\\nstandards that define the relationship between a company’ s management on one hand and \\\\nits shareholders and stakeholders, namely the bondholders, workers, suppliers, creditors \\\\nand consumers, on the other hand. More strictly, the term “corporate governance” \\\\nprovides answers to many questions including : How can the owners make sure that the \\\\nmanagement does not misuse their money? How can they make sure that the management \\\\nacts towards maximizing the company’s share value and profitability in the long run? How much does the management care about the basic interests of the society such as \\\\nhealth and environment? And lastly, how can shareholders and stakeholders effectively \\\\nsupervise the management? \\\\nThe term corporate governance raises so me ambiguity for three main reasons \\\\nrelated to the modernity of the term itself. Th e first reason is that the roots of the concept \\\\nof corporate governance and many of the issues linked with it go back to the beginning of \\\\nthe 19\\\\nth century and were dealt with by some or ganization and management theories as \\\\nwell as the “enterprise theory.” The term itself started to be used in the English language and its concepts began to crystallize only two or three decades ago. The second reason is that there is no definite meaning for this concept. Some people consider it to be a \\\\nmechanism that allows companies to get financ ing and to magnify the value of its shares \\\\nand secure its continuity in the long run. Others define it fr om a legal pers pective as the \\\\ncontractual relationship (be it complete or in complete) which defines the rights and duties \\\\nof the shareholders and the stakeholders on one hand, and of the managers on the other \\\\nhand. Another group may look at it from a social and moral viewpoint and hence \\\\nconcentrate on the company’s social responsibil ity to protect the ri ghts of the minority \\\\nshareholders or junior investors, to realize equitable so cioeconomic developments and \\\\nprotect the environment. The th ird and last reason behind th e vagueness of this term is \\\\nthat the concept itself is still in its formation stage, and its principles  and rules continue to \\\\nbe revised and developed. \\\\nNevertheless, there is a sort of ag reement between the researchers and \\\\npractitioners on the major determinants and eval uation criteria of this concept. As for the \\\\n3 \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ndeterminants, it is agreed that, good or bad, governance depends on the presence and \\\\nquality of two groups of determinants: external and internal (see Figure 1). External determinants refer to the general investment climate in the state, including: laws that \\\\nregulate market performance (such as capital market, companies, competition and anti-trust, and bankruptcy laws); th e efficiency of the financial sector (the banks and capital \\\\nmarket) in providing the necessary financi ng for projects; the competitiveness of the \\\\ncommodities markets and the factors of production, and the efficiency of the supervisory bodies and authorities (the Capital Market  Authority and the Stock Exchange) in \\\\nexercising strict control over the companies. This is in addition to some self-regulating \\\\ninstitutions that ensure the markets’ e fficient performance (such as professional \\\\nassociations that provide vari ous codes of ethics for the market participants such as \\\\nauditors, accountants, lawyers, companies worki ng in the securities market, etc.). There \\\\nare also institutions for inde pendent professions such as law offices, auditing offices, \\\\ncredit rating offices and financial and investment consulta tion offices. The presence of \\\\nexternal determinants is important for providing a sound corporate governance \\\\nenvironment and ensuring the enforcement of  laws and rules that reduce the conflict \\\\nbetween social and private returns. \\\\nInternal determinants, on the other hand, refer to rules and principles that \\\\ndetermine the decision-making process and the division of responsibilities among the \\\\ngeneral assembly, the board members, and the executive directors of the company. The \\\\npresence and the application of these rules a nd principles reduce the conflicts of interest \\\\nbetween those three parties. \\\\n \\\\n      \\\\n4 \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nFigure 1: External and Internal Determinants  \\\\n \\\\n         External Determinants                             Internal Determinants  \\\\n \\\\n          Organizational                            Private \\\\n \\\\nCriteria  \\\\nAccounting \\\\nAuditing Others \\\\nLaws and rules  Stakeholders        Shareholders  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n     Board of Directors  \\\\n  \\\\nAppoints           Reports \\\\n      &    to \\\\nSupervises \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n     \\\\n          Management\\\\n \\\\n          Performs basic \\\\n              functions  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\nFinancial Sector  \\\\nLoans \\\\nShare capital \\\\n   participation Private Institutions * \\\\n \\\\nAccountants and \\\\nauditors \\\\nLawyers \\\\nCredit rating \\\\nInvestment banks \\\\nConsultation \\\\nFinancial analysis \\\\nFinancial information  \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\nMarkets  \\\\nMarket Competitiveness \\\\nForeign Direct     Investment \\\\nCompanies Supervision  \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\n   * Private institutions refer to the private sector elements, self-management entities, mass media  \\\\n   organizations, civil society and agencies that provide information, raise the level of control over \\\\n   companies and shed light on the opportunist behavior of the management. \\\\n   Source: Iskander and Chamlou (2000). \\\\n \\\\nIn 1999, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \\\\nlaid out five sets of princi ples as guidelines to assess th e level of corporate governance \\\\napplication:1 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Rights of Shareholders: These include the rights to  transfer the ownership \\\\nof their shares, to vote in  the general assembly, to select board members, to \\\\nreceive dividends from their shares, to revi se financial statements and the right to \\\\nactive participation in the general assembly meetings. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Equitable Treatment of Shareholders : This means equal treatment of \\\\nshareholders in all categories and the defens e of their legal rights, as well as their \\\\nright to vote in the general assembly on fundamental decisions, to be protected \\\\n                                                 \\\\n1  OECD is revising these principles. Revised principles are expected to be issued before the end of 2003. \\\\n5 \\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nagainst any suspicious mergers or acquisitions and from insider trading, as well as \\\\ntheir right to be informed of all transactions involvi ng the board members or the \\\\nexecutive managers. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Role of Stakeholders in Corporate Governance : This includes the respect \\\\nof their legal rights and compensating them for any breach of these rights. It also includes mechanisms to enhance their pa rticipation in supervising the company \\\\nand access to the required information. Stakeholders include the bond-holders, workers, banks, suppliers and customers. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Disclosure and Transparency : This includes the disclo sure of key information, \\\\nthe role of the auditor, a nd the ownership of the major ity of shares, as well as \\\\ndisclosure related to the board members and executives. Disclosure should take place in a timely manner and without dela y and will be conducted fairly among \\\\nshareholders and stakeholders alike. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Responsibilities of the Board : These include its structure, its legal duties, \\\\nthe board member selection process, its ma in functions and its supervisory role of \\\\nthe executive management. \\\\nCorporate governance is important because, if applied properly, it helps to realize \\\\nhigh and sustainable growth rates. It increases confidence in the national economy, \\\\ndeepens capital market and increases its ability to mobilize savings and raise investment \\\\nrates. Moreover, it protects the rights of the minority shar eholders or small investors. \\\\nCorporate governance also enc ourages the growth of the pr ivate sector by supporting its \\\\ncompetitive capabilities, helping to secure financing for projects, generating profits and creating job opportunities.  \\\\nCorporate governance has been gaining increasing importance over the last two \\\\ndecades for several reasons. First and fore most, the switch by many of the world\\\\'s \\\\ncountries to capitalist economic systems that  rely greatly on private companies for the \\\\nrealization of high and sustainable economic gr owth rates. The expansion of these private \\\\nprojects led to a separation between corporate ownership an d management. As a result, \\\\n6 \\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nprojects started looking for financial sources that were less expensive than banks, so they \\\\nheaded to the capital markets. This was made easier by the liberalization of capital \\\\nmarkets in many parts of the world. Capital began to move across borders at \\\\nunprecedented rates. The expansion of project  volumes and the separation of ownership \\\\nfrom management weakened supervisory mech anisms on managers’ behavior and caused \\\\nmany companies to fall into financial distress.  The most serious of these was the South \\\\nEast Asian crisis at the end of the 1990s, which was followed by other crises involving \\\\ncompanies such as the Enron and WorldCom in the US in 2001. All these factors placed \\\\ncorporate governance at the top of the worl d concerns. Discussions were held in an \\\\nattempt to mend the deficiencies in the pr inciples and rules regulating companies’ \\\\nactivities, especially those concerned with  the role of financial auditors and the \\\\nresponsibilities of the board of directors. \\\\nEgypt started to give due importance to  the subject of corporate governance in \\\\n2001 with an initiative taken by the Minist ry of Economy and Foreign Trade (now the \\\\nMinistry of Foreign Trade). The Ministry wa s of the opinion that  the economic reform \\\\nprogram initiated in the early 90s could only be completed by installing an organizational \\\\nand supervisory framework that governs the pr ivate sector performance in the context of \\\\nliberalized markets. A study was conducted to a ssess the extent of th e conformity of the \\\\nEgyptian legal, regulatory and supervisory fr amework to the international criteria of \\\\ncorporate governance. The study aimed to trace and assess development achieved during the period from September 2001 to March 2003 in  completing the rules and determinants \\\\nthat ensure the proper application of corporat e governance in Egypt.  \\\\nThe following sections of this report include  an overview of the various aspects of \\\\nthe capital market as well as five main secti ons that assess the development of corporate \\\\ngovernance in Egypt according to the five principles introduced by OECD in 1999.  \\\\n \\\\nPreliminary Section: Comprehensive Vi ew of the Capital Market in Egypt\\\\n \\\\nThis section deals with the vari ous aspects of the capital market  such as the activity of the \\\\nStock Exchange, the legal and supervisory fr amework that governs corporate operations \\\\nand finally, the ownership stru cture of the traded shares. \\\\n7 \\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nStock Market Structure \\\\nEgypt\\\\'s Stock Exchange dates back to the 19th century. The Alexandria and Cairo Stock \\\\nExchanges were officially established in 1883 and 1903, respectively. Both exchanges \\\\nwere very active in the 1940s, and ranked fifth in the world.2  In spite of their dormancy \\\\nbeginning in the 1960s, they were never clos ed. They were revived in the early 1990s \\\\nwhen the government adopted an integrat ed program for rest ructuring economic \\\\nstabilization; especially af ter the issuance of Law No. 95/1992. Egypt\\\\'s Stock Exchange \\\\nis comprised of two trading exchanges, one in Cairo and the second in Alexandria. \\\\nSecurities are automatically registered in both exchanges and listing fees are mutually \\\\ndivided. \\\\nIn December 2002 there were about 29,000 a ssociations of capital in Egypt \\\\nincluding about 22,000 joint stock companies,  280 limited-by-shares companies, and \\\\n7,000 limited liability companies.3  The legal framework allows for listing only joint \\\\nstock companies and limited-by-shares co mpanies. Listed companies enjoy tax \\\\nexemption equivalent to the value of the paid-in capital multiplied by the interest rate, which is decided by the Central Bank of Egypt  every three months. The number of listed \\\\nbusinesses rose from 656 companies in 1992 to 1,151 companies in December 2002. While the legal framework for companies’ continued listing in the Stock Exchange \\\\nrequires at least one trading operation per company every six months, it is difficult to \\\\nsubstantiate this requirement.\\\\n4  Market capitalization incr eased from approximately LE \\\\n11 billion in 1992 (8 percent of the GDP) to LE 123 billion in 2002 (32 percent of the \\\\nGDP).5  The value of traded shares rose fr om LE 371 million in 1992 (3.4 percent of the \\\\nmarket capital value) to r each a peak of LE 42 billion in 2000 (35 percent of the market \\\\ncapital value) then declined to LE 26 million in 2002 (21 percent of the market capital \\\\nvalue) due to domestic and global events. \\\\n                                                 \\\\n2 Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (http:/www.mbendi.Co.za/exch/12/p005.htm). \\\\n3 Stock Exchange Monthly Bulletin , January 2003 and Report of the Ministry of Foreign Trade on Egypt’s \\\\nStock Market performance during 2002. \\\\n4 Such operations are mostly performed by individuals related to the company just to keep it listed. \\\\n5 Annex No. 1 shows Stock Exchange performance development from January 1992 to December 2002. \\\\n8 \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nTo date, nine Egyptian companies are listed on the London, Luxembourg and \\\\nFrankfurt Stock Exchanges through th e Global Depository Receipts (GDR).6  GDR \\\\ntrading value reached Pound Sterling 440 million in 2002. As of January 2003, there were \\\\n13 mergers among listed companies, and 108 pur chasing and acquisition cases involving \\\\ncompanies from the real estate, tourism, pharmaceutical, banks, energy, insurance, \\\\ncement, communications, food and beverage sect ors. International companies represented \\\\nmore than one-third of the buyers.7  Several indexes are used for measuring the \\\\ndevelopment of Cairo and Alexandria Stock Ex changes the most important of which are: \\\\nthe Capital Market Authority Index; CASE 30 issued by Cairo and Alexandria Stock \\\\nExchanges in March 2003; Standard & Poor’s ; Morgan Stanley MS Investible Index, in \\\\naddition to indexes for dome stic financial enterprises.8 \\\\nLegal and Supervisory Framework \\\\nThe legal and supervisory framework includes all the laws that gove rn the securities \\\\nmarket in Egypt and the supervisory agencies that regulate its market activity. The \\\\nfollowing is a short description of the most important laws and agencies. \\\\nLegal System \\\\nThe Egyptian legal system is largely influen ced by the French Civil Law. However, the \\\\nlaws governing capital market performance, su ch as the Central Depository Law and the  \\\\nCapital Market Law, are based on the Anglo- American Law. The major laws regulating \\\\ncapital market performance are outlined below. \\\\nThe Capital Market Law (No. 95/1992)  governs the capital market, provides the \\\\nlegal framework for the Cairo and Alexandria  Stock Exchanges and sets the rules for \\\\nlisted businesses. The Capital Market Law is currently undergoing a process of revision \\\\nand intensive amendments. The proposed draft law provides mo re active support for \\\\nminority shareholders, presents a new concept for legal action, define s procedures to be \\\\nadopted in purchase tenders, and totally bans trading on insider information. It is \\\\nexpected that the Egyptian People’s Asse mbly will discuss the draft law in 2003. \\\\n                                                 \\\\n6 In addition to the Receipts of th e Holding Financial Investments Co.

This law \\\\nbecame effective after its executive regulations  were issued by the Minister of Foreign \\\\nTrade Decision No. 906 in November 2001. \\\\nAs for companies, there are three laws governing the establishment of a company \\\\nthat will be listed on the Stock Exchange:9 \\\\nThe Law on Joint Stock Companies, Limited by Shares Companies and Limited \\\\nLiability Companies (No. 159/1981)  regulates joint stock companies, limited-by-shares \\\\ncompanies and limited liability companies.10  By virtue of this law, the share capital of a \\\\njoint stock company is divided into shares of  equal value. The shareholders’ liability is \\\\nlimited to the value of the issued shares. As for the limited-by-shares companies, the \\\\nshare capital includes the portion that belongs to the joint partner(s) and shares of equal \\\\nvalue for subscription by one or more subscrib ers. The joint partners  are responsible for \\\\nthe company’s liabilities and their responsibil ity is unlimited. However, the subscriber’s \\\\nresponsibility is limited to th e value of his shares. A limite d liability company is not \\\\nallowed to issue tradable shares. \\\\nThe Investment Guarantees and Incentives Law (No. 8/1997)  was created to boost \\\\ninvestments in various economic sectors and specific industrial z ones through income tax \\\\nexemptions for 5, 10 or 20 years or permanently  in tax-free zones. This Investment Law \\\\nrefers to the Companies’ Law N o. 159/1981 in all other aspects. \\\\nThe Public Business Sector Law (No. 203/1991) cited 314 public sector \\\\ncompanies to be sold.11  These companies were established as joint stock companies and \\\\nthen became affiliated companies under 17 holding companies as of 1991. Once private ownership reaches 51 percent of the company’ s shares, it becomes subject to Law No. \\\\n159/1981. \\\\nEfforts are underway to draft and disc uss a unified law that would replace a \\\\nnumber of the current laws and dispersed provisions. It would ensure  that all businesses \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n9 In addition to Capital Market Law No. 95/1992, Chapter Three. \\\\n10 Amended by Laws No. 212/1994, 3/1998 and 159/1998. \\\\n11 190 companies were privatized from the beginning of the privatization program until June 30, 2002. \\\\n10 \\\\n--- Page 14 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n(capital corporate sector and individuals’ companies) in E gypt are adhering to a unified \\\\nmodernized regulatory system that facilitates investors’ dealings with the administrative \\\\nauthorities and enhances transparency.  \\\\nGovernmental and Quasi-Governmental Supervisory Agencies  \\\\nThe supervisory agencies that regulate, s upervise and monitor the capital market and \\\\nensure the proper applicati on of corporate governance fall into two categories: \\\\nGovernmental Agencies and Quasi-Govern mental (or self-regulatory) Agencies. \\\\nThe Capital Market Authority (CMA)   \\\\nCMA is a government agency subject to the supe rvision of the Minister  of Foreign Trade. \\\\nHowever, it is an independent agency. Its board  of directors is its supreme authority. Two \\\\nof its seven board members, namely, the chairman and the deputy chairman, are \\\\nappointed by a Presidential Decree for a period of three renewable years. The other board \\\\nmembers are appointed by a decree of the Pr ime Minister for a period of two renewable \\\\nyears. The Capital Market Authority is primarily funded by its revenues from accrued \\\\nfees. The salaries of the Authority’s employees  are high in comparison to the salaries of \\\\ntheir peers in the government sector. Foreign technical and financia l support enabled the \\\\nAuthority to hire skilled pr ofessionals and pay them high salaries. Nevertheless, their \\\\nsalaries are lower than those of employees in the private sector and in the Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria Stock Exchanges. The Capital Market Authority is responsible for the enforcement of the Capital Market Law a nd for supervising market development and \\\\nregulating, as well as mon itoring all its activities. \\\\nMoreover, the Capital Market Authority has the competence to impose \\\\nadministrative sanctions including warnings, writing off from the tables, suspending or \\\\ncanceling licenses,\\\\n12 canceling operations or bargains13 (even after settlement in case of \\\\nany illegal action or behavior), conducti ng inspection operations and suspending the \\\\n                                                 \\\\n12 The common sanction is to suspend the brokerag e license for a period not exceeding one month. \\\\n13 Immediate cancellation (before settlement) is the responsibility of the Chairman of the Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria Stock Exchanges.  \\\\n11 \\\\n--- Page 15 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ngeneral assembly’s decisions for a period of fift een days in the case of verified damage to \\\\nminority shareholders.14 \\\\nThe Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges \\\\nThe Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (CASE), a quasi-self-regulatory authority by \\\\nvirtue of law, is managed by an elected board  of directors under the supervision of the \\\\nCapital Market Authority (CMA). The board  comprises eleven members: the Stock \\\\nExchanges\\\\' chairman who is appointed by th e Prime Minister, six members representing \\\\ntrading companies, two members representi ng banks, one member from the Central Bank \\\\nof Egypt and one member from the CMA. The Capital Market Authority has the right to \\\\nobject to the decisions issued by CASE’s board  of directors. CASE is responsible for \\\\nensuring commitment to listing rules, but has no  authority for investigation or inquiries. \\\\nCASE may impose sanctions that range from transferring a company from the formal to \\\\nthe non-formal table, suspending trading, or writing off the registration according to the \\\\nnature and type of infringement. \\\\nMisr Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository Company   \\\\nThis joint stock company was established ac cording to the provisions of the Capital \\\\nMarket Law No. 95/1992. CMA issued its approval on 21/8/1994 to establish the \\\\nCompany as a self-regulatory entity subject to CMA’s supe rvision and responsible for \\\\nenforcing the Central Depository Law No. 93/2000. Misr Clearing, Settlement and \\\\nCentral Depository Company comprises members from securities’ brokerage companies, depository trustees licensed by CMA, issu ers of securities, banks and financial \\\\ninstitutions willing to participate in the Company provided they practice brokerage or \\\\ndepository trustees\\\\' activities. \\\\nMisr Clearing, Settlement and Central De pository Company is the sole central \\\\nauthority in Egypt entrusted with CASE’s clea ring and settlement operations. It is also \\\\nresponsible for the application of the centr al depository system in Egypt including \\\\nverification of the central ow nership of the securities trad e in the Stock Exchange and \\\\ntransferring trading to book entries for easy ha ndling by shareholders. \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n14 The Authority may ask defaulters to increase their portion of the insurance fund of Stock Exchange \\\\noperations. \\\\n12 \\\\n--- Page 16 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nThe General Authority for Investment and the Capital Corporate Sector  \\\\nThe Capital Corporate Sector (formerly the Company’s Administration) supervises the \\\\nenforcement and application of the Compan ies Law No. 159/1981. This Sector is subject \\\\nto the General Authority for Investment a nd Free Zones (instead of the Ministry of \\\\nEconomy and Foreign Trade) under Deci sion No. 415/2001. The Sector has the \\\\ncompetence to reject applicati ons for the establishment of companies and to ratify the \\\\nirregular general assembly’s decisions to liq uidate a company. The General Authority for \\\\nInvestment supervises companies es tablished according to Law No. 8/1997. \\\\nThe Ministry of P ublic Business Sector \\\\nThis Ministry and in particular the hold ing companies are responsible for companies \\\\nestablished according to Law No. 203/1991. \\\\nPrivate Institutions  \\\\nIn addition to the governmental and quasi-gove rnmental supervisory bodies, two types of \\\\nprivate institutions operate in the market. The first type is the non-pr ofit or self-regulatory \\\\ninstitutions that help ensure  discipline in the capital market, and the second comprises \\\\nprofit-driven private institutions. \\\\nNon-Profit Private Institutions \\\\nThe Egyptian Capital Market Association  was established in 1996 as a professional \\\\nassociation comprising 250 member s representing most of the companies operating in the \\\\ncapital market.15  It is the main body for conveying the opinions of the workers in this \\\\nfield to the supervisory agencies for c onsideration while drafting capital market \\\\nregulations and laws. The Association orga nizes training courses for the employees, \\\\nconvenes seminars for raising public awareness of investment, and resolves disputes that \\\\nmay arise between its members or between them and other parties. \\\\nEgyptian Association for Investment Management was founded in 2001. The \\\\nAssociation comprises members from financ ial and investment establishments, banks, \\\\ninsurance companies and asset managers. Through training courses and workshops, it \\\\n                                                 \\\\n15 The draft Capital Market Law proposes to make membership of this Association mandatory and to \\\\nconvert it to a self-regulatory organization.  \\\\n13 \\\\n--- Page 17 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nacts to enhance the members’ efficiency and improve the quality of the services they \\\\nprovide investors. Further, it issues a professional certificat e to portfolio managers to \\\\nensure performance quality and qualification. \\\\nThe Egyptian Accountants and Auditors Association  was founded in 1946 with \\\\nthe main objective of promoting the professi onal and technical levels of accounting and \\\\nauditing nationally and internationally. In addi tion to its essential role in the study of \\\\ndraft economic laws on topics such as taxes and investment and pr eparing accounting and \\\\nauditing standards according to decisions of the Minister of Foreign Trade, the \\\\nAssociation participates in st udies and research on economic  laws, taxes and investment. \\\\nThose who have university degrees and post-gr aduate degrees in accountancy fields and \\\\nhave served for several years in accredited accountancy offices are allowed to join the \\\\nmembership of the association provided they pass the examinations held by the Association.  \\\\nProfit-Driven Private Institutions  \\\\nThere are several profit-driven  practitioners competing at the capital market. They \\\\ninclude auditors, accountants, law c onsultants, credit-rating companies,\\\\n16 financial \\\\nanalysts and information dissemination companie s, securities brokerage firms, promoters, \\\\nunderwriters and asset management firms a nd law offices. To ensure the quality and \\\\naccuracy of financial disclosure, the Au thority approves a group of auditors.17 \\\\nNevertheless, Egypt’s Capital Market lacks ma rket makers who act to guarantee a regular \\\\nperformance of the market by buying or sel ling shares and thus preventing sharp and \\\\nunjustified declines or increases in prices.18  It is worth noting that a market maker may \\\\nalso be a brokerage company. \\\\n \\\\n                                                 \\\\n16 There are seven credit-rating companies in Egypt accredited by the Capital Market Authority. The \\\\nmajority of the accreditation committee must be from  one of the accredited in ternational credit-rating \\\\ninstitutions. To ensure impartiality, banks and auditors are not allowed as partners  in these companies.   \\\\n17 The Capital Market Authority keeps a list of 55 accredited auditors for investment funds. The Ministry of \\\\nFinance accredits the auditors of joint stock comp anies. The Central Accoun tancy Authority accredits \\\\nauditors for the public capital companies. As for bank s, the auditors are accredited by the Central Bank of \\\\nEgypt. For the Insurance companies,  they are accredited by the Insuranc e Supervisory Authority. The Real \\\\nEstate Authority will be responsible for accrediting the list of auditors for real estate finance companies.  \\\\n18 They sell shares when demand is higher than supply and buy shares when supply is higher than demand. \\\\n14 \\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nRegistration and Listing Requirements  \\\\nCompanies that issue shares must present the prospectus to the Capital Market Authority \\\\nfor revision and approval in order to guara ntee the companies’ compliance with the \\\\nconditions. As soon as the application is approved, a company may disseminate and \\\\ndistribute its issuance prospectus as the fi rst step in offering shares for public \\\\nsubscription. A summary of the prospectus  must be published in two daily morning \\\\nnewspapers in Arabic language  designating where the issuance prospectus is available. \\\\nRegistration and disclosure procedures of the Cairo and Alexandria Stock \\\\nExchanges were updated in order to ensu re the proper applic ation of corporate \\\\ngovernance principles. According to the ne w registration rules, as of August 2002, \\\\ncompanies are now registered in one of four  tables instead of three: Formal Table 1, \\\\nFormal Table 2, Informal Table 1 and Informal  Table 2. Formal Table 2 was added to list \\\\nsecurities issued by the state for public subscr iption, securities issu ed by public sector \\\\ncompanies subject to Law No. 97/1983, and the public business sector companies subject \\\\nto Law No. 203/1991, all of which were formerly listed in Formal Table 1. \\\\nThree criteria were added to the new regist ration rules to conform to international \\\\nstandards. They are: profita bility, number of shareholde rs, and the minimum level of \\\\ncompanies’ share capitals. These criteria  defined and differentiated between public \\\\nsubscription and private subscription for the first time in Egypt. A company’s securities \\\\nwill be considered a private subscription if  the number of shareholders through their \\\\ntrading process reaches 50 or more; and will be considered a public subscription if the \\\\nnumber of shareholders through their trad ing process reaches 100 or more. Thus, a \\\\ncompany will not have the choice of being register ed in a particular table, as was the case \\\\nbefore. Registration takes place according to the criteria available in every company.19  \\\\nThe new rules oblige companies to publis h their registration applications on the \\\\ninternet and the Stock Exchange daily bulletin to give those concerne d the right to object \\\\nto the Registration and Cancellation Committee within ten days from the publication \\\\n                                                 \\\\n19 Some practitioners say that some registration rules ar e difficult to adhere to such as the condition of \\\\nissuing financial statements every three months (it is suggested to be every six months) and obliging the \\\\nauditing committee of the company to present monthly auditors’ reports (it is suggested to make them \\\\nquarterly or biannually). \\\\n15 \\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ndate. From August 1, 2002, the Stock Exchange  started the adoption of a system for \\\\nregistering agents at the Stock Exchange to  make it easier for companies to complete \\\\ntheir registration procedures through them. According to the trading rules of the Stock \\\\nExchange, the CMA supervises the shares’ pr ice movement, which should be within a 5 \\\\npercent increase or decrease. But by virtue of the criteria issued by the Minister of \\\\nForeign Trade Decision No. 441 in July 2002, th ese price limitations were removed from \\\\nthe most active shares (which reached 14 shares in March 2003). Price limitations are \\\\nexpected to be lifted from all the remaining shares as well. There are no price limitations \\\\non bonds and the closing price is left for the market mechanisms except for the bonds \\\\nconvertible to shares, which are subject to current price limits.  \\\\nThe new rules gave companies with securiti es listed on the Stock Exchange tables \\\\na period of one year from 1/8/2002 to 31/7/2003 to adapt the registration position of their securities according to the ne w registration rules. Thirty-four companies harmonized their \\\\npositions as of 31/12/2002, i.e., 2.95 percen t of the total registered companies.\\\\n20 \\\\nOwnership Structure  \\\\nIn 2002, investment percentage reached 17 per cent for individuals (15 percent nationals \\\\nand 2 percent foreigners), 78 percent for en terprises (64 percent national and 14 percent \\\\nforeign) and 5 percent for investment funds (1 percent national and 4 percent foreign). \\\\nPensions and Insurance Funds invest a sma ll portion of their assets in shares only. \\\\nThe number of public businesses that were privatized and that publicly trade their \\\\nstock reached 190 in 2002. Most of them were sold  to an anchor investor or were sold to \\\\nthe majority through the Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, the state s till keeps a share of \\\\nmany of the privatized companies through holding companies, and is the principal shareholder of those companies. In such cases , the structure of the board of directors and \\\\nupper management is often identical to their structure before privatization. A decision \\\\nwas issued in March 2003 to sell the remaining portions in these companies to the private sector, which had a positive effect on thei r market trading value. The portion of the \\\\nemployee shareholders union in these companies ranges between 5 percent and 10 percent.  \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n20 All the changes in the rules of re gistration will be duly discussed. \\\\n16 \\\\n--- Page 20 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n1. Shareholders’ Rights  \\\\nThis section deals with the ex tent to which shareholders are protected through the legal \\\\nframework. It includes the right to transfer the ownership of their shares, to vote in the \\\\ngeneral assembly, to select board members, to obtain dividends from their shares, to \\\\nrevise the financial statements and the right to active participation in the general \\\\nassembly meetings. \\\\n1/1. Fundamental Rights \\\\nThere are no restrictions on tr ansferring the ownership of shares registered in the stock \\\\nexchange.21  On January 1, 2001 almost 62 percent of  all shares were material (share \\\\nwarrants). But book trading (without handling share warrant) expanded to reach 99.6 \\\\npercent of total Stock Exchange trading in 2002. The Central Depository and Registry \\\\nLaw obliged all the registered companies to register at Misr Clearing, Settlement and \\\\nCentral Depository Company. The total number of companies registered reached 870 in December 2002.\\\\n22  The remaining 278 companies registered at the Stock Exchange were \\\\nnot registered at the Central Depository. \\\\nClearing and settlement are made on the basis of cash-on-delivery in the sense \\\\nthat securities are delivered to the buyer against the payment of its value to the seller. If securities are deposited at Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository Company, \\\\nthe purchased securities are de livered to the buyer in the fo rm of book entries, i.e. they \\\\nare added to the buyer’s account  of securities at the depos itory company and at the \\\\nconcerned depository trustees at the same time  when their value is added to the settlement \\\\naccount of the selling broker.\\\\n23  It is worth mentioning that  settlements of operations \\\\nimplemented on active securities whose price re strictions on market trading were lifted \\\\nare made on the second day after trading (T +2). Settlements implemented on the other \\\\n                                                 \\\\n21 According to Article 63 of the Capital Market Executive Regulations No. 95/1992, the founders’ shares \\\\nare non-transferable for 2 years, whereas according to Article 45 of the Companies Law No. 159/1981 the \\\\nqualifying shares of the board members become transfer able as soon as a manager resigns or is dismissed \\\\nby the annual general assembly and the board of directors is acquitted. \\\\n22 Of these companies, 860 are re gistered at the Stock Exchange  and 10 are not registered.  \\\\n23 Depository trustees are responsible for the management and depositing the accounts of securities’ traders. \\\\nIn addition to Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central De pository Company, there are 16 banks that provide \\\\ndepository services. The five major banks in this field are: the National Bank of Egypt, Commercial \\\\nInternational Bank, Citibank, American Express and HSBC. \\\\n17 \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nsecurities in central deposito ry are made on the third day af ter trading (T+3). Settlements \\\\nimplemented on material share warrants are ma de on the fourth day af ter trading (T+4).  \\\\nBefore the Central Depository Law was i ssued, all the clearing and settlement \\\\noperations were made according to ISSA- 630 recommendations with the exception of \\\\nthree subjects: the effective payment system with geographical spread, securities lending \\\\nand borrowing, and the registration of all th e companies registered  at Misr Clearing, \\\\nSettlement and Central Depository Company. Th e latter was dealt with by the Central \\\\nDepository Law as mentioned earlier. The law also addressed the subject of securities \\\\nlending and borrowing and decided the neces sary means to ensure that Central \\\\nDepository members would meet their obligations regarding settlements in securities, including a system for lending securities to Central Depository members. However, the \\\\nregulations that organize the implementation of lending operations have yet to be issued. \\\\nThe Settlements Guarantee Fund was esta blished in January 2000 with capital \\\\nprovided by securities brokerage companies pro rata  the volume of th eir trading at the \\\\nStock Exchange. The Fund is run as a self-r egulatory organization under the supervision \\\\nof the Capital Market Authority. The Fund’s main function is to protect the investor \\\\nagainst non-commercial risks and to guarantee the implementation of  the financial and \\\\nsecurities settlement operations liabilities for trading operations at the Stock Exchange in \\\\ncase either party fails to fulfill its obligation to the other. \\\\nAs for the lack of a system of bank paym ents that are geographically widespread, \\\\nnegotiations are ongoing between the Central Bank of Egypt and Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository Company to  allow the Company to discount and add \\\\non the Banks’ accounts at the Central Bank of Egypt according to the results of the securities’ trading operations. Presently, shar eholders can obtain the interest on their \\\\nprofits from 42 bank branches in 10 governorat es covering all the regions of Egypt from \\\\nCairo and Alexandria to the Delta and Upper E gypt, in addition to all of the branches of \\\\nthe Central Depository Company. According to the Law, profits have to be distributed \\\\nwithin 30 days from the issuance of the general assembly decision. Disbursement takes place either in cash, by cheques, bank transf ers or by personal delivery from the Central \\\\n18 \\\\n--- Page 22 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nDepository Company to the customer’s pre-determined address.24  The system is not \\\\nlimited to interest disbursement, but incl udes bonds yields, depreciation values, and \\\\nrepayments for the restructuring of issuing companies deposited at the Central Depository \\\\nCompany. \\\\n1/2. The General Assembly Meetings and Disclosure of Financial Statements \\\\nThe Companies’ Law No. 159/1981 stipulated th at the annual general assembly should be \\\\nconvened within three months from the end of the previous financial year. It also \\\\nstipulated that summaries of the financial st atements and the audito rs’ reports should be \\\\npublished in two daily newspapers or sent by registered mail to every shareholder at least \\\\n15 days before the date of the general assembly meeting. The  chairman of the board of \\\\ndirectors chairs the annual m eeting of the general assembly. The invitation to the meeting \\\\nmust include date, time and place of the meeti ng as well as the agenda, the annual report, \\\\nthe auditors report (if not published), and the board of directors’ re port. In addition to \\\\nnotifying the shareholders, thr ee other parties must be notified, namely the auditor, the \\\\nCapital Market Authority and the administ rative bodies to whic h the listed company \\\\nbelongs. \\\\nAs mentioned earlier, the Capital Market Authority has a superv isory role over all \\\\nthe companies registered at the Stock Mark et whether they are founded according to Law \\\\nNo. 8/1997 or Law No. 203/1991. In addition to  CMA’s supervisory role, companies \\\\nfounded according to Law No. 8 /1997 and Law No. 159/1981 are subject to the supervision of the General Authority for Investment; and companies founded according \\\\nto Law No. 203/1991 are subject to the supervision of the Ministry of  the Public Business \\\\nSector or rather, the holding company. \\\\nContrary to Law No. 159/1981, trading in  or transferring the ownership of \\\\nsecurities shall not cease during the conventi on of the general assembly of the company \\\\nthat issued the shares. However, trading in th e securities of an investor willing to attend \\\\nand vote in the general assembly shall ceas e so that he preserves his position as a \\\\nshareholder. But practically speaking, this is  difficult to implement. The legal quorum for \\\\nconvening the general assembly is three board  members at least (as mentioned in the \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n24 In the case that the shareholder belongs to one of the special categories such as widows or senior citizens.  \\\\n19 \\\\n--- Page 23 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ncompany’s statutes), the auditor and a number of the shareholders representing at least \\\\none-fourth of its share capita l. If this quorum is not reached, an invitation may be \\\\naddressed for a second meeting. No minimum quorum is required for the second meeting \\\\nunless the company’s statutes stipulate a higher percentage. \\\\nShareholders representing 5 percent of a company’s share capital may add items \\\\nto the agenda up to three days before the meeting. The Law does not stipulate whether the \\\\ncompany has to distribute the amended agenda publicly before convening its general assembly. It is also possible to discuss any urgent matters and vote on them without \\\\nhaving them listed in the agenda if the majority of the shareholders present at the meeting agree they are worthy of discussion. Sharehol ders may ask questions, and the board of \\\\ndirectors must answer them provided they  do not cause “any harm to the company’s \\\\ninterests or to public interest”. If the c oncerned parties consider  the answers to be \\\\ninsufficient, they may call the general assembly to make a decision on that subject. \\\\nShareholders who paid 50 percent or less of  the shares’ issue value are entitled to \\\\nall voting rights. However, the profits they may obtain are pro rata  their paid-in amounts. \\\\nVoting may be in person or by proxy, but  voting by proxy is subject to certain \\\\nrestrictions. If the principal is a natura l person, the representing person should be a \\\\nshareholder (this does not a pply to non-physical persons), who has a power of attorney \\\\nand is not a member of the board of directors.\\\\n25  A natural person is not allowed to \\\\nrepresent more than 10 percent of the total shares and 20 percent of the shares represented in the meeting (thi s does not apply on non-physical shareholders). Voting is \\\\nby secret ballot if it is concerning the el ection, dismissal or penalization of a board \\\\nmember or if the board chairman or sharehol ders who represent one-tenth of the capital \\\\nattending the meeting call for a secret ballot . The general assembly appoints two of the \\\\nattendees, in addition to the s ecretary of the session, to count the votes and supervise the \\\\nvoting and casting process. In the past, voting was not allowed by regular mail or by e-mail, but this option is now available for shareholders. However, it has yet to be applied.  \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n25 Board members are not allowed to vote in person or on behalf of one or more shareholders because it is \\\\nthe shareholders who call board of directors to question. \\\\n20 \\\\n--- Page 24 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nThe Central Depository Law differentiates between the register ed owner and the \\\\nbeneficiary owner. Executive regulations gi ve registered owners  the right to vote on \\\\nbehalf of all the beneficiary owners (block voting). The law also allows the registered \\\\nowner to fragment the votes of the benefici ary owners. This means that they can cast \\\\ndiffering votes on the same subject. \\\\nShareholders can get information on thei r voting rights on the different categories \\\\nof shares either from the company’s statutes, from the commercial registry at the Ministry \\\\nof Supplies and Internal Trade for a required fee,26 or from the Association of Capital \\\\nSector. Another source of information is  the company’s issuance prospectus and \\\\nbrokerage offices. In the past, it was not neces sary to disclose the capital structure or the \\\\nreal structure of ownership in the annual report. But new rules made it obligatory for \\\\nregistered companies to forward biannual reports to the Stock Ex change (on 31/12 and \\\\n30/6) that include th e shareholders’ structure. More over a company has to forward a \\\\nreport as soon as a radical change takes pl ace in the shareholders’ structure throughout \\\\nthe year. \\\\nShareholders have the right to review th e financial statements, which include the \\\\ncompany’s financial position, income statemen ts, cash flows, changes in equity and the \\\\nattached clarifications and th e auditors’ report for the past  three years. The information \\\\ncan be reviewed at the company’s headqua rters for two weeks before the general \\\\nassembly meeting, provided a signed applicati on for revision is filed. Article 15 of the \\\\nStock Exchange registration ru les concerning disclosure obliges registered companies to \\\\ndesignate a person responsible for relations with  the shareholders to act as a liaison with \\\\nthe Stock Exchange and to answer the queri es of the shareholders and investors. \\\\nThe Companies Law No. 159/1981 gives shar eholders who own 5 percent of the \\\\nshare capital the right to call for the annual m eeting of the general assembly if the board \\\\nof directors does not call for it. Extraordinar y meetings of the general assembly may be \\\\nheld according to the request by shareholders owning 10 percent of th e capital shares or \\\\nby the board of directors. The legal quorum of the first meet ing must be 50 percent of the \\\\nshare capital unless the statutes stipulate a higher percentage. If the quorum is not \\\\n                                                 \\\\n26 LE 20 per copy. \\\\n21 \\\\n--- Page 25 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nreached, the quorum for the second meeting will be 25 percent of the share capital. The \\\\nauditor and the Associations of Capital S ector may also call for an ordinary or \\\\nextraordinary meeting of  the general assembly. \\\\n \\\\n2. Equitable Treatment of Shareholders  \\\\nEquitable treatment of shareholders refers to  equality among of the holders of shares in \\\\neach category, the right to defend their legal rights, to vote in the general assembly on \\\\nfundamental decisions, to be protected against any suspicious mergers or acquisitions and \\\\ninsider-trading, and their right  to be informed of all the transactions of the board \\\\nmembers and the executive managers. \\\\n2/1. Voting Rights \\\\nEgypt’s legal framework allows for multi-shar es categories provided the shareholders of \\\\nany category are treated similarly and equall y. There are two main categories of shares: \\\\ncommon shares and preferen ce (or preferred) shares.27 Common shares are either \\\\nregistered (sometimes called “nominal”) or to-the-holder.28  The holder shares should not \\\\nexceed 25 percent of the total shares and they  must be paid in full. Owners of holder \\\\nshares may take part in the annual meeting of the general assembly if their shares are \\\\ndeposited at the bank, the issuer company or  at Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central \\\\nDepository Company, but they do not have the right to vote. \\\\nOwners of preferred shares enjoy three advantages. Firs t, advantages related to \\\\nvoting: they may have multi-votes accordi ng to the statutes of  the issuer company.29  \\\\nSecond, the owners of “profit-co llecting” preferred shares ha ve the right to be paid a \\\\ndefined and fixed percentage of the revenue  before any other profits are distributed. \\\\nThird, priority upon liquidation and priority in  share capital increase.  The share capital \\\\nmay be increased through preference shares if a company’s statutes stipulated such a \\\\n                                                 \\\\n27 Most of the shares traded in Egypt are ordinary shares. Ordinary shares represented 99.6 percent of the \\\\ntotal market capital on 31/1/2003, whereas traded pr eference shares represented 0.4 percent. Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria Stock Exchanges, Monthly Bulletin , January 2003. \\\\n28 Holder or bearer shares were in troduced by the Capital Market Law No. 95/1992 (Article No. 1 of the \\\\nExecutive Regulations), but the holder does not have the right to vote. \\\\n29 In most cases, the voting rights comprise a maximum of  two votes per share. But there is no legal limit. \\\\n22 \\\\n--- Page 26 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nclause upon incorporation and if it is approved at an extraordinary meeting of the general \\\\nassembly according to a suggestion by the board of directors and the auditors, who must \\\\ndeclare their justification for this action.30 \\\\nEvery shareholder has the right to submit a complaint to the concerned \\\\nadministrative agency regarding any violation of the law. A shareholder who attends the \\\\nannual meeting of the general assembly and re gisters his objection to a certain decision in \\\\nthe minutes of the meeting has the right to file  a lawsuit before the court within one year \\\\nfrom the date of the meeting. Article No. 76 of the Companies Law No. 159/1981 \\\\nstipulates that all the decisions issued in fa vor of a specific categor y of shareholders or \\\\ncausing any damage or harm to them or decisi ons offering special bene fits or advantages \\\\nto the board of directors sha ll be nullified. Furthermore, shareholders who represent 5 \\\\npercent or more of the share capital are entitled to submit a complaint to the board of directors of the Capital Market Authority. CM A shall have the right and the authority to \\\\ncancel the decisions of the annual meeting of th e general assembly if they are deemed to \\\\nbe in favor of a specific category of sharehol ders or may cause any damage or harm to \\\\nthem or offer unfair benefits or advantag es for the board of directors or others. \\\\nShareholders who represent 10 percent or more of the share capital are entitled to ask the \\\\nCapital Market Authority or  the Capital Corporate Sect or to conduct surveys and \\\\ninspections.  \\\\nIn the past, the Capital Market Law allowed traders at the Stock Exchange to \\\\nresort to mandatory arbitration. But because legal actions are costly and time-consuming, \\\\nthe High Constitutional Court ruled in Janua ry 2002 that mandatory arbitration is \\\\nunconstitutional. However, optional arbitra tion is still allowed. The Stock Exchange \\\\nrecently announced a project to  establish, in collaboration wi th the Cairo International \\\\nArbitration Center and the CMA, a new cente r for dispute settlemen t and arbitration for \\\\nthe securities market by the e nd of the current year (2003). The new system aims to \\\\naccelerate the resolution of disputes occurring between the stock exchange traders and the \\\\nsecurities’ companies without resorting to th e judicial system, which is often a lengthy \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n30 Companies whose statutes did not stipulate upon incorporation the possibility to increase share capital \\\\nthrough preference shares ar e not allowed to issue these shares. Howe ver, there are attempts to amend the \\\\nlaw so as to allow this process by a special majority. \\\\n23 \\\\n--- Page 27 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nprocess, especially since there are no judici al circuits specializing in capital market \\\\nlawsuits or in economic disputes.31  The proposed draft Capital Market Law allows CMA \\\\nto file collective lawsuits on behalf of the shareholders. Th is is what is called a class \\\\naction lawsuit.32 \\\\n2/2. Participation in the Comp any’s Fundamental Decisions  \\\\nVoting must be conducted with a two-thirds majority for decisions related to granting \\\\nadvantages to the present shareholders before  increasing the share capital, failure to apply \\\\nthe priority rights if stated in the compa ny’s statutes, or adding new items to the \\\\ncompany’s objectives. Similarly, two-thirds of  the shareholders in the same category \\\\nmust agree in order to make any changes to their voting rights. Voti ng shall be conducted \\\\nwith a 75 percent majority for decisions relate d to increasing or decreasing share capital, \\\\nchanging the original purpos e of the company, prolonging or shortening the duration of \\\\nthe company or deciding to dissolve or merg e the company. If the attained losses reach \\\\n50 percent of the issued share capital, the board  of directors must call for an extraordinary \\\\nmeeting of the general assembly to consid er whether to dissolv e or continue the \\\\ncompany. \\\\n2/3. Follow-Up and Supervision of Companies  \\\\nAny person willing to buy shares  that will raise his ownership to 10 percent or more of \\\\nthe share capital has to send prior notice to  the company by registered mail two weeks \\\\nbefore the completion of the purchase. Within  one week from receiving this notification, \\\\nthe company must inform the shareholders w ho own at least 1 percen t of the company or \\\\npublish such information in two widespread newspapers. The allowed ownership limit for \\\\nboard members or employees is 5 percent of  the share capital. This process must be \\\\ncompleted within one month fr om the notification date. If  the percentage exceeds 20 \\\\npercent for shareholders before or after the planned ownership (15 percent for the \\\\ndirectors and employees), an offer to purchas e the required portion of the share capital \\\\nmust be issued to all shareholders. The offer may be for all the shares or just for a portion of the shares. The offered price must be at least equal to the aver age closing price during \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n31 Researches are currently being conducted to establish specialized legal circuits. \\\\n32 The Draft Law allows the filing of collective lawsuits on behalf of the shareholders. \\\\n24 \\\\n--- Page 28 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nthe month that preceded the notification. The purchase offer remains valid for a period of \\\\ntwo weeks, and may be extended. If the offere d shares are more than required, the buyer \\\\nmust buy from all the shareholders pro rata  their shares. Recentl y, CMA has started to \\\\nrefuse purchasing offers that may cause th e buyer to own the majo rity of the company \\\\nunless the offer is for 100 percent of the shares . This is to avoid one shareholder having \\\\ncontrol over the management of the comp any while the minority shareholders are \\\\nnegatively affected. \\\\n2/4. Insider Trading and Self-Dealing  \\\\nEgypt’s legal framework does not deal with the subject of in sider trading and self-dealing \\\\nin a definite manner. Article No. 64 of th e Capital Market Law No. 95/1992 deals with \\\\nany person who discloses secrets under his co ntrol by virtue of hi s duties or job, whose \\\\nwife or children benefit from disclosing intern al information related to his job, who uses \\\\nimportant, false misleading or incorrect information, or who omits any important \\\\ninformation from the reports he makes to th e extent that affects the results of those \\\\nreports. Despite its presence, this provision is insufficient. In order to secure the \\\\nefficiency of supervision on trading in insi der information, it is suggested that each of \\\\nthese cases be properly defined. \\\\nThe new rules oblige companies to observe certain disclosure procedures \\\\napplicable to those who deal with the companies’ information and internal secrets. The \\\\nprocedures address the following issues. \\\\n- Persons who obtain the information in a secret manner should not trade in the securities of the concerned company un til the information becomes publicized. The \\\\ncompany must provide the Stock Exchange with any information in this respect, \\\\nespecially concerning the persons w ho have access to such information. \\\\n- If the company is willing to announce information in its general assembly that may cause a tangible change in the value of the listed shares, the company must take the necessary procedures to convey such info rmation to CMA and the Stock Exchange. \\\\nThis ensures that such information will not be made available to shareholders before \\\\n25 \\\\n--- Page 29 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nit is published on the trading monitors, whic h occurs at the same time it is announced \\\\nto the shareholders attending the meeting. \\\\n- The board members, officials and persons who have access to internal information \\\\nagree that they will not buy or sell the co mpany’s securities according to internal \\\\ninformation not disclosed to the public. \\\\n- The adopted internal supervisory procedures prevent the board members, managers \\\\nand employees from trading the company’s sh ares fifteen days before and three days \\\\nafter issuing or publishing any essential data or information that may cause an \\\\nimportant change in the co mpany’s securities price. \\\\n- The adopted internal supervisory procedures oblige the company’s board members, officials and persons who have access to the internal information to inform the exchange market and CMA of any opera tions they conduct to buy or sell the \\\\ncompany\\\\'s securities at leas t 24 hours before the implementation of such operations.  \\\\nCMA created a database for all the indivi duals who have access to the companies’ \\\\nsecrets and other sources of information. Cadr es working in the trading supervisory field \\\\nat the Stock Exchange and CMA were trained in the USA in the most recent techniques \\\\nin this field. Guidelines were al so prepared for methods of action. \\\\nThe Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges are responsible for immediate \\\\nsupervision during trading, while CMA is responsible for subsequent supervision after trading. A group of professional supervisors work  at CASE both in Cairo and Alexandria. \\\\nSome of them work with the brokers in the compartment. Others observe market activity \\\\nto discover any insider trad ing or self-dealing. The Supervision Department inspects \\\\ntrading through code numbers for investors.  It  is also possible to inspect them by their \\\\nnames through the Information Department or  through brokers’ ledge rs and orders. CMA \\\\nand CASE are connected electr onically online. In case of manipulation in prices, the \\\\nchairman of CASE or CMA suspends the o ffer/tender prices and cancels the operations. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n26 \\\\n--- Page 30 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n2/5. Deals with Related Parties  \\\\nEgypt’s accounting standards require that board members and managers disclose the \\\\ntrading, bargains and other businesses conduc ted with related part ies, including board \\\\nmembers or managers, regardless of whether such operations were already made or are \\\\ngoing to be made. Disclosures must be writte n with the clarifications attached to the \\\\nfinancial statements. A board member who has any conflict of interest must inform the \\\\nboard of directors, record it in the minutes of the meeti ng, and abstain from voting. The \\\\nboard of directors must inform the annual ge neral assembly of any operations with the \\\\nrelated parties. \\\\nThe new registration rules defined the nature of dealings with related parties that \\\\nthe companies have to inform the Stock Exchange about, including: \\\\n\\\\x83 A summary of the important contracts of the company or of any related \\\\ncompanies during the two years that pr eceded the registration application. The \\\\nsummary should include the amounts paid to or from the issuing company or its affiliates. \\\\n\\\\x83 The organizational structure of the company that shows whether it is a holding or an affiliate company. \\\\n\\\\x83 The capital structure including the percenta ge of the shareholders who own more \\\\nthan 5 percent of the holding company and its affiliates. \\\\n\\\\x83 Statement of the transactions between  the issuing company and any of the \\\\nshareholders in the company or in its affiliates. \\\\n 3. Stakeholders’ Role in Corporate Governance\\\\n \\\\nThis section analyzes to what  extent Egypt’s legal framewor k allows stakeholders to own \\\\na portion of the shares, to be informed of the company’s essentia l operations, and how it \\\\nprotects their interests. Stakeholders in clude the bondholders, workers, banks, suppliers \\\\nand customers. \\\\n \\\\n27 \\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n3/1. Respect of Legal Rights  \\\\nThe Companies’ Law No. 159/1981 gives the workers the right to 10 percent of the \\\\ncompany’s distributed profits with a maximu m limit of their salary for one year. This \\\\nright can only be exercised in the case of profit distribution. The Law also gives the \\\\nworkers the right to participate in the manage ment of the company. Its statutes decide the \\\\nmost suitable methods and rules to be applied in this concern, with  the exception of the \\\\npublic business sector. Presently, there are no representatives for workers on companies\\\\' \\\\nboards of directors. Instead, companies esta blish “workers committees” or other similar \\\\nbodies to handle matters for the workers including wage and other compensations. One of the board members is responsible for liaison with this committee. On the other hand, the \\\\nCapital Market Law No. 95/1992 gives bondholders  special protection. For example, they \\\\nhave the right to form bondholders’ associations  and elect a legal representative to work \\\\non their behalf and attend the annual m eetings of the general assembly. These \\\\nassociations issue recommendations for the annual general assembly or the board of \\\\ndirectors, but do not have the right to vote in the general assembly meetings. \\\\n3/2. Compensation for Rights Violation \\\\nStakeholders’ rights are prot ected by contracts and by certa in laws such as the Labor \\\\nLaw, the Environment Law or the Bankruptcy System.\\\\n33  Stakeholders have the right to \\\\nresort to legal procedures for compensation for any violations of their rights.34  \\\\n3/3. Mechanisms to Promote Stakeholders’ Participation  Workers may establish federations or associat ions with the purpose of owning shares or \\\\ndistributing profits. The workers shareholders associations must be registered with CMA \\\\nand must have written statutes. Only the wo rkers of the company are entitled to its \\\\nmembership. The board of direct ors runs the association and its  ultimate authority lies in \\\\nthe general assembly. The Workers\\\\' shareholde rs associations in privatized companies \\\\nown 5 percent of the share capita l on behalf of the workers. The association is usually \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n33 The organization of bankruptcy rules is, at the pr esent time, subject to the Commerce Law. But the new \\\\nCapital Market Law will handle defaulting companies’ problems in a manner similar to that of the Federal \\\\nBankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the US Code. Chapter 7: Liquidation, and Chapter 11: Reorganization.  \\\\n34 In the case of a merger, stakeholders are protect ed by a condition that does not allow prejudice of \\\\ncreditors’ rights, and that stakeholders have priority in case of a company\\\\'s liquidation.  \\\\n28 \\\\n--- Page 32 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ngiven a seat on the board of di rectors when it owns 10 percent of the share capital if the \\\\nstatutes specify that shareholders ar e represented on the board of directors pro rata  the \\\\nshares they own. It is also allowed to re-buy the sold shares. In this case, the shares are \\\\ncalled treasury stocks35 and the re-buying process is called share buyback. Sometimes \\\\nthese shares are distributed to workers. Treasury stocks may be kept for no more than one \\\\nyear, then they are either resold or the general assembly is called for a meeting to make a decision on reducing the share capital by the nom inal value of the treasury stocks. Some \\\\ncompanies have share ownership programs for their employees and executive managers,\\\\n36 \\\\nbut there is no definite system  for such programs to date. \\\\n3/4. Access to Information \\\\nWorkers, in their capacity as shareholders, have the right to gain access to the same \\\\ninformation as other shareholders. The bondhol ders’ group has the ri ght to review the \\\\nfinancial statements and send a representative to  participate in the annual meetings of the \\\\ngeneral assembly. \\\\n \\\\n4. Disclosure and Transparency  \\\\nThis section deals with all aspects of disc losure and transparency in relation to the \\\\ncompany’s activities and th e role of the auditor. \\\\n4/1. Disclosure of Important Information  \\\\nEvery company registered at the Stock Exchan ge is obliged to disclose its financial \\\\nposition and its operational performance to the CMA and CASE. This disclosure takes \\\\nplace either annually or quarterly. The informati on that must be disclosed in the financial \\\\nposition and the income statements include s the changes in equities, cash flows, \\\\ncomplementary clarifications of  the statements, the report of the board of directors, and \\\\nthe report of the external auditor. \\\\n                                                 \\\\n35 Treasury stocks have two characteristics: 1) they do not have the right to vote; 2) they do not have the \\\\nright to profits. The company buys its shares if the ma rket price is unfair. So, it buys some of its traded \\\\nshares and distributes the profits to fewer shareholde rs in order to improve th e company’s market value. \\\\n36 Such programs are not included in the company’s statutes.  \\\\n29 \\\\n--- Page 33 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nCMA examines the financial statements to ensure the company has met the \\\\nrequirements and the extent to which the statements conform to Egyptian accounting \\\\nstandards. CMA may ask a company to disclo se and publish more items than it has in \\\\nprevious years.  If a company fails to m eet this condition, CMA publishes its comments \\\\non the company’s financial statements at the cost of that company. Companies are also \\\\nobliged to publish complete summaries of  their annual and biannual reports in two \\\\nwidespread daily newspapers; at least one of  them must be in Arabic. Companies must \\\\nprepare their financial statements according to the Egyptian accounting standards, which \\\\nare issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and are mostly in harmony with international \\\\naccounting standards. In this context, it is worth mentioning that in  2002 the Ministry of \\\\nForeign Trade issued (by Ministerial Decree No. 345) three new standards in harmony with international accounting standards and other standards are st ill under preparation. \\\\nAccording to said Ministerial Decree, companies have to apply the international accounting standards if no parallel  Egyptian standard is issued.\\\\n37 \\\\nCompanies also have to immediately disclose to CMA and CASE all the \\\\nimportant events that may affect the comp any’s financial positi on or its operational \\\\nturnover. As soon as the Stock Exchange is  informed, it must publish the information \\\\nimmediately on the monitors and inform the brokerage companies. The Disclosure \\\\nDepartment of the Stock Exchange supervises  the companies to ensure they make the \\\\nrequired disclosures. According to the new registration rules, the Stock Exchange may \\\\nimpose penalties and sanctions on companie s that deliberately disclose wrong or \\\\nmisleading information in their financial statem ents. The penalty for failing to conform to \\\\ndisclosure rules is elimination from registra tion tables. The new registration rules impose \\\\nfinancial penalties on companies that do not  observe the rules of transparency and \\\\nperiodical disclosure of material inform ation, financial statements and non-financial \\\\ninformation.  \\\\nThe following are the major points of the new disclosure rules: \\\\n                                                 \\\\n37 This is with the exception of leasing standards pr epared according to the Egyptian requirements, which \\\\ndo not group the leased assets with the assets of th e lease-holder, but consider them assets owned by the \\\\nlessor that appear in his balance sheets.  \\\\n30 \\\\n--- Page 34 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n\\\\x83 Companies shall inform the Stock Exchange  of any material events that affect \\\\ntheir activities or financial position, or a ffect the trading of its shares. Companies \\\\nmust report these events immediately and no tify the Stock Exchange at a time that \\\\nallows it to publish these events on the m onitors immediately or before the first \\\\nsubsequent trading session afte r the occurrence of these events as well as in the \\\\nfirst bulletin issued after th e occurrence of the events. This Article stipulates what \\\\na company must do if important or em ergency events occur during formal \\\\nholidays. The Article gives examples of such events. \\\\n\\\\x83 Important events are published in co ordination with the company and the \\\\nmanagement of the Stock Exchange. Publishing does not take pl ace during trading \\\\nhours unless the information must be pub lished immediately. In such a case, \\\\ntrading on the company’s securities will be suspended for a period to be decided \\\\nby the Stock Exchange Chairman, pr ovided it does not exceed one hour. \\\\n\\\\x83 The company must take the necessary precau tions to secure the confidentiality of \\\\nthe financial information and to prevent any deliberate or accide ntal leak before it \\\\nis announced to traders. \\\\n4/2. The Auditor \\\\nCompanies have to submit their annual and biannual financial statements following the \\\\nrevision and approval of the auditor. Quarterly financial statements are to be submitted \\\\ntogether with a limited examination report. In this context, it is wo rth noting that the new \\\\nregistration rules necessitate that the co mpany’s upper management, executive manager \\\\nand financial manager must verify that there is no unrecorded information that may affect \\\\nthe company’s financial position and that ther e are no lawsuits filed against the company \\\\nthat may require building-up a dditional allocations other than those mentioned in the \\\\nfinancial statements. \\\\nThe annual general assembly has the manda te and the authority to appoint the \\\\nauditors and to determine their compensation. It is not necessary to disclose the fees for consultative services at the annual general assembly meeting. However, the new rules of \\\\nautonomy necessitate that audi tors should not provide any co nsultation to a company for \\\\nwhich they examine and audit its accounts unl ess they obtain a license from the Auditing \\\\n31 \\\\n--- Page 35 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nCommittee. An auditor should not be one of  the company’s founders, board members, \\\\nemployees or related by any other means to th e company or its board of directors. There \\\\nis nothing to prevent an a uditor from being a shareholde r of the company he audits, \\\\nwhich is against the principles of autonomy. An auditor is not allo wed to become a board \\\\nmember or an employee of the company until th ree years after the expi ry date of his work \\\\nas its auditor.  \\\\nAn auditor has the right to examine all documents, data and the other necessary \\\\ninformation and to ask for the support of the board of directors to help him realize his \\\\nmission. If the auditor can not get all the in formation he deems necessary to accomplish \\\\nhis goal, he may forward a report to the boa rd of directors or the general assembly \\\\ndenoting that he will not e xpress his opinion due to insuffi cient information. The auditor \\\\nmust inform the general assembly to which he is also going to subm it his auditor’s report. \\\\nAny shareholder may submit a request for the dismissal of the auditor up to ten \\\\ndays before the date of the general asse mbly’s meeting after providing, in writing, his \\\\njustifications for the dismissal. The auditor ha s the right to reply to this motion in a letter \\\\ndefending the actions that were subject to cri ticism and consideration. The auditor is held \\\\nresponsible for any mistakes or distortion of f acts, and is responsible  for indemnifying the \\\\ncompany and/or the shareholders for any dama ge resulting thereof. The new registration \\\\nrules require companies to form internal  auditing committees and to disclose the \\\\ncommittee\\\\'s activities to the financial community. All the members of these committees \\\\nmust be non-executive board members. These committees may also comprise non-board members and experts in order to supervise th e internal auditing activities and to appoint \\\\nthe auditor, determine his f ees and discuss his reports. \\\\nThe first step any potential auditor must take is to register  his name at the \\\\nMinistry of Finance. After eight years of serv ice and gaining experience, he or she will be \\\\nentitled to audit the accounts of any company without having to sit for an examination. \\\\nThis is with the exception of the Egyptian Accountants and the A uditors Association \\\\n(1,350 active members in a country compri sing about 18,000 registered accountants) \\\\nwhose membership is only granted after passing high standard examinations.  \\\\n32 \\\\n--- Page 36 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nIt is worth noting that the Egyptian A ccountants and Auditors Association in \\\\ncooperation with the Ministry of Finan ce, the Commercial Syndicate, CMA and the \\\\nCentral Accountancy Authority prepared a draft law (an amendment of the current Law \\\\nNo. 133/1951) to regulate practicing the acc ounting and auditing professions in Egypt. \\\\nThe draft law was discussed at the State Council and was referred to the government in preparation for forwarding it to the People’ s Assembly for approval. The draft law \\\\ncomprises articles that deal with the strict  supervision of auditors’ performances and \\\\npreconditions for registration at the account ants’ tables, especially sitting for the \\\\nexaminations as stipulated by the Law. It also provides for the establishment of a Higher Council for Supervision and Monito ring of the Accounting Profession.\\\\n38  The Council \\\\nwill form a sub-committee responsible for mon itoring and supervising the performance of \\\\nthe auditors of companies registered in the Stock Exchange and for inspection and \\\\nimposing penalties on those who do not conf orm to the Egyptian and international \\\\naccounting standards. \\\\n4/3. Disclosing Ownership of the Majority of Shares \\\\nAccording to the Central Depository Law, the settlement company must keep a registry \\\\nof detailed information on the beneficiary owne rs, which are obtained from the registered \\\\nowners. Nobody is allowed access to this registry  except the issuers of securities and the \\\\nauthorized bodies within the limit that concerns each of them. The Law requires \\\\nregistered owners to disclose details of the beneficiary owners. The companies as well as \\\\nMisr Clearing, Settlement and Central De pository Company keep registries for \\\\nshareholders and update them continuously; however these registries do not denote the \\\\nownership of the ultimate beneficiary. Companie s must present these registries to their \\\\nannual general assemblies. Shareholders have  the right to review  the minutes of the \\\\ngeneral assembly meeting, which include, as annexes, the names of all the registered \\\\nowners and the number of shares owned by each of them. Such information must also be \\\\n                                                 \\\\n38 The majority of the council would be comprised of non -accountants. It will be chaired by the Minister of \\\\nFinance, with members from the CMA, the Insura nce Supervisory Authority, the General Investment \\\\nAuthority, the Central Accountancy Authority and a re presentative from each of the Egyptian Accountants \\\\nand Auditors Association, the Free Professions Pr actitioners’ Branch  and a number of accounting and \\\\nauditing experts. \\\\n33 \\\\n--- Page 37 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nmade available to the administrative bodies (t he Investment Authority, the Associations \\\\nof Capital Sector and the holding companies).  \\\\nRecently, CASE has started to demand th at the most active companies – which \\\\namount to about 30 companies and form CA SE’s index – disclose their ownership \\\\nstructure of 5 percent or more.39  Under all circumstances, this  practice is not considered \\\\nmandatory either by virtue of the law or the current regulations.40  The new Capital \\\\nMarket Law as well as the new registration rules aim to promote ownership disclosure. \\\\n4/4. Disclosure for Board Members and Executive Directors \\\\nThe board members\\\\' degree of disclosure, wh ich must be presented to the company’s \\\\ngeneral assembly, is decided by the company’ s statutes. For example, the names of the \\\\nboard members and their remuneration are disc losed to the annual general assembly, but \\\\nsuch information is not published in the a nnual report. The board members\\\\' remuneration \\\\nincludes their fees and travel  allowances, and their annual portion of the profits which \\\\nshould not exceed 10 percent of the net income  (after discounting 5 percent as statutory \\\\nreserve and 5 percent to the paid in capital as  divisible profits). Th e executive directors’ \\\\ncompensation is not disclosed. CMA asks the companies to present annual lists of names \\\\nand nationalities of their board members and key officials and managers as well as any \\\\ninformation or relevant details regarding them. CMA must be informed immediately of \\\\nany changes that take place on such lists. \\\\nBoard members have to disclose any conf licts of interest and should not vote on \\\\nboard decisions connected with such conflicts. The board conveys such information to \\\\nthe annual general assembly. Board members mu st obtain special authorizations from the \\\\nannual general assembly in order to trade fo r their own interests in the same business \\\\nsector or to be a party to any contract presented to the board for approval. They should \\\\nalso not enter into contracts with other companies and take fees from them if their \\\\ncolleagues are board members, managers or executives in these companies. \\\\n \\\\n                                                 \\\\n39 This is important when the Law requires certain limits of ownership such as airline companies. \\\\n40 The Capital Market Law requires disclosu re of 10 percent of the share capital. \\\\n34 \\\\n--- Page 38 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n4/5. Disclosure of Other Information \\\\nA relatively low number of companies publis h formal annual reports in addition to the \\\\nrequirements stipulated by the Companie s Law No. 159/1981 and the Capital Market \\\\nLaw No. 95/1992. According to the latter, a co mpany that issues debt instruments for \\\\namounts exceeding the net value of its assets must get an annual rating from the rating \\\\ninstitutions accredited by CMA. \\\\n \\\\n5. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors  \\\\nThis section deals with the structure of th e board of directors, the selection of its \\\\nmembers, its main functions and its supervisory role ove r the executive management. \\\\n5/1. Structure and Legal Responsibilities \\\\nThe board of directors’ membership consists  of an odd number with a minimum of three \\\\nmembers. There are no rules that govern the board structure from executive or non-\\\\nexecutive managers. So far the concept of the “independent board member” is not clearly \\\\napplied in most of the companies in Egypt . The board chairman is often also the \\\\nmanaging director. The board member responsi ble for administration is sometimes called \\\\nthe managing director or the executive director; and the board  decides his/her \\\\nremuneration. Board members must be shar eholders or repres entatives of the \\\\nparticipating companies with the excepti on of two members (as a maximum) who are \\\\nchosen because they are “experts in the fiel d”. The board elects its chairperson and his \\\\ndeputy sometimes, and has the right to change them any time. The board holds its meetings at the request of its chairperson or two-thirds of its members. The board \\\\nmeeting is considered valid if the number of attendees is not less than half of its members \\\\nplus one, provided the number of attendees  is not less than three board members. \\\\n5/2. Selection of Board Members \\\\nThe annual general assembly el ects board members for a period of three renewable years \\\\nand decides their remuneration. Election condi tions include the owne rship of a minimum \\\\nnumber of shares as indicated  in the company’s statutes (with the exception of the two \\\\n35 \\\\n--- Page 39 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nexperts). These shares will be kept as qualification shares until the expiry of the board’s \\\\nterm and the ratification of the last annual report by the annual general assembly.41 \\\\nA worker can not be appointed as a board member if his period of service at the \\\\ncompany is less than 2 years. There should be  no more than three executive managers on \\\\nthe board of directors. Board members should agree in writing on th e appointment of the \\\\nexecutive managers and their CVs should be sent to the general assembly provided they contain lists of the companies at which they  worked during the previous three years. \\\\nManagers may serve on a maximum of two boards, but managing directors should only \\\\nserve on one board with the exception of the ma nager who owns at least 10 percent of the \\\\ncompany’s share capital. Board members lose their qualification immediately if they declare bankruptcy or commit a criminal action or a serious crime such as robbery, \\\\nbreach of trust or forgery. Shareholders may dismiss or fire managers. The law penalizes managers who commit crimes of bribery or forgery, give misleading information, divide \\\\nillusionary profits or enter into self-dealings. Penalties include imprisonment and/or fines according to the gravity of the infringement. \\\\n5/3. Main Responsibilities \\\\nThe board of directors is the high authority that governs the company or enterprise. It is \\\\nresponsible for supervising the implementati on of the company’s objectives as decided \\\\nby its general assembly. The board is responsib le to the shareholders  as deputy for them. \\\\nConsequently, all the provisions of proxy in the Egyptian Civil Law are applicable to the \\\\nboard of directors. The board is also legally responsible for any distortion or forgery of \\\\nthe company’s information. For example, ever y board member is subject to imprisonment \\\\nfor not less than 2 years and a fine ra nging between LE 2,000 and LE 10,000 if profits are \\\\ndivided in a manner different from the pr ovisions of the Companies’ Law No. 159/1981 \\\\nor the company’s statutes. The functions of the board of directors include: inviting the \\\\nshareholders to meet, investing the company’s funds, requesting loans, appointing executive managers and submitting financial st atements and board reports to the annual \\\\ngeneral assembly meeting. Th e board report also includes a summary of activities and \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n41 It is worth noting that Egypt allows an artificial person to be a board member, which is why there are \\\\noperational difficulties. Only France and Belgium also  allow an artificial person as a board member. \\\\n36 \\\\n--- Page 40 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nproposed plans for the coming year. The board of  directors may also allow an increase in \\\\nthe company’s share capital w ithin the authorized limits without the need for a special \\\\ndecision from the shareholders or from the general assembly. \\\\n5/4. Independent Supervision \\\\nBy virtue of the Egyptian laws, the annual ge neral assembly, the board of directors, the \\\\ninternal and external auditors and the governmental agen cies all supervise and monitor \\\\nthe company’s management. The annual general assembly is considered the top authority \\\\nand all its decisions are binding. But in practice, shareholders do not play an active role in \\\\nsupervising and monitoring management. In most companies, there is no actual \\\\nseparation between the board of directors and the executive management. It is a one-tier \\\\nstructure of management. The board of dir ectors does not include independent members, \\\\nnor does it form ad hoc committees to consider assigned subjects.42  Some companies do \\\\nnot appoint an internal auditor. Even in comp anies with internal auditors, their authority \\\\nis very limited. CMA and the administrative supervisory bodies, upon the request of the \\\\nshareholders (and within their authoritie s and mandate), supervise the company’s \\\\nmanagement through inspection activities. Representatives of the Investment Authority, the Associations of Capital Sector and CMA attend the general assembly’s meetings to \\\\nguarantee the integrity of the administrative pr ocedures and make sure that the issued \\\\ndecisions are not biased toward a group of sh areholders at the expense of the remaining \\\\nshareholders. If there is d oubt about the board’s actions, the concerned agencies issue \\\\norders for examination and inspection. The Central Accounting Authority audits the \\\\naccounts of companies with state owne rship of more than 25 percent. \\\\n Conclusion: Main Results and Recommendations\\\\n \\\\nDevelopments at the Cairo a nd Alexandria Stock Exchanges indicate that the period from \\\\nSeptember 2001 to March 2003 witnessed consid erable progress in corporate governance \\\\nstandards in Egypt, with s ubsequent improvement of the overall assessment of these \\\\nstandards (Table 1). Standards that conf orm completely or considerably to the \\\\n                                                 \\\\n42 With the exception of the execu tive committees which are responsible for the day-to-day operations. \\\\n37 \\\\n--- Page 41 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ninternational corporate governance standards rose from 40 to 45 standards. The number \\\\nof standards unobserved in Egypt dropped from 8 to only 3 standards. \\\\n \\\\nTable 1: Development of the Overall Assessment of Corporate Governance Rules in Egypt, \\\\nSeptember 2001 to March 2003 \\\\n Completely \\\\nObserved Considerably \\\\nObserved Slightly Observed Not Observed \\\\nSeptember 2001 Assessment* 14 26 6 2 \\\\nMarch 2003 Assessment ** 24 21 2 1 \\\\nSources:  * Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade (2001). \\\\n ** As calculated by researchers.  \\\\nThe assessment showed that progress was achieved in the five principles of \\\\ncorporate governance, but the degree of impr ovement differed from one principle to \\\\nanother. According to this assessment, the order of the five corporate governance \\\\nprinciples in Egypt based on th eir degree of conformity to in ternational standards is as \\\\nfollows: the stakeholders’ role in corpor ate governance, equitable treatment of \\\\nshareholders, shareholders’ rights, disclosure and transparency, and responsibilities of the \\\\nboard of directors.43 \\\\nThe following are the most important pr ocedures undertaken from September \\\\n2001 to March 2003 that had a tangible eff ect in improving the overall assessment. \\\\n\\\\x83 Shareholders’ Rights \\\\no It became possible to vote by ordina ry mail or electronic mail at the \\\\ngeneral assembly meetings. \\\\no Development of registration rules to conform to the international \\\\nprinciples of corporate governance. \\\\no Provision of safe methods for regi stration, settlement and profit \\\\ndistribution, and the establishment of the Settlements Guarantee Fund. \\\\no The establishment of dis pute resolution center.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n                                                 \\\\n43 Annex No. 2 contains a detailed assessment of the five principles and a comparison with the assessment \\\\nof October 2001. \\\\n38 \\\\n--- Page 42 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n\\\\x83 Equitable Treatment of Shareholders \\\\no CMA’s right to suspend the decision s of a general assembly that are \\\\nbiased to a specific category of shareholders. \\\\no Allowing the registered owner to vote on behalf of the beneficiary owner \\\\neither totally or severally.  \\\\no The issuance of the new disclosure rule s that allow for strict supervision of \\\\ninsider trading. \\\\no The organization of acquisition opera tions and purchase offers and \\\\nallowing class action lawsuits. \\\\n\\\\x83 The Stakeholders’ Role in Corporate Governance \\\\no The establishment of shar eholders’ groups and allo wing representatives of \\\\nthe groups to attend the ge neral assembly meetings.  \\\\no Licenses to form the workers\\\\' shareholders associations.  \\\\n\\\\x83 Disclosure and Transparency \\\\no The development of disclosure require ments of financial and non-financial \\\\nstatements, and their electronic dissemination.  \\\\no Draft Law for practicing the accounti ng and auditing profession in Egypt.  \\\\no The obligation to appoint a person responsible for the shareholders’ \\\\naffairs.  \\\\n\\\\x83 Responsibilities of the Board of Directors \\\\no Obliging the companies to appoint in dependent or non-executive members \\\\nto the board of directors.  \\\\no Obliging the companies to form auditing committees from non-executive board members.  \\\\no Obliging the companies to disclose th e ownership structure, the principal \\\\nshareholders and the report of the board of directors. \\\\n39 \\\\n--- Page 43 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nIn spite of this remarkable progress, there is still a need to complete the legal \\\\nframework for corporate governance, and a great need to enhance the application of \\\\ncorporate governance principles. The major fiel ds that still need additional efforts are: \\\\nprotecting the minority share holders’ rights; ensuring the board’s performance of its \\\\nfunctions and the strict supervision of its actions; em phasizing disclosure of the \\\\nownership structure details; completing the legal framework; and increasing the \\\\nefficiency of the supervisory bodies. The fo llowing are some detailed suggestions for \\\\nimproving these issues. \\\\n\\\\x83 Enhance the instruments for protecting th e minority shareholders by, for example, \\\\nestablishing a mechanism to protect their rights similar to the shareholders’ group, \\\\nstarting the implementation of class ac tions and amending the rules governing \\\\npurchase offers to ensure more eff ectiveness in protecting the minority \\\\nshareholders. The executive regulations s hould stipulate that if the ownership of \\\\nany shareholder reaches 40 percent of the share capital, he has to purchase the \\\\nremaining shares. Those who own bearer  shares should be allowed to vote \\\\nprovided they pay the complete value of th e shares in order to enjoy voting rights. \\\\n\\\\x83 Establish rules that facilitate the perfor mance of the board by obliging companies \\\\nto appoint non-executive or independent boa rd members, to activate the role of \\\\nthe auditing committees and to appoint an independent auditor. Moreover, \\\\ncompanies should publicize their implementa tion of the principles of corporate \\\\ngovernance after the approval of CMA and the Stock Exchange. There is no doubt \\\\nthat the establishment of a training ce nter for managers and informing board \\\\nmembers and executive managers of joint stock companies of their corporate \\\\ngovernance duties will help improve the board’s  activities especia lly in relation to \\\\nits supervision of the executive management.  \\\\n\\\\x83 Secure the thorough and accurate disclosu re of material and non-material \\\\ninformation so that it includes the register ed owner and the beneficiary owners in \\\\nthe equity statements and the cross-holdi ng structure. Doing this would show the \\\\nessential interests of every shareholde r, the final owner of any share, the \\\\nattendance percentage of board members in  order to make the shareholder aware \\\\n40 \\\\n--- Page 44 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nof the time a member gives to managing the company, and finally it would \\\\nsupport the automatic disse mination of disclosure. \\\\n\\\\x83 Complete the legal framework that secu res the proper applic ation of corporate \\\\ngovernance. This includes issuing the ame nded Capital Market Law, the unified \\\\nCorporate Law, the draft law on pr acticing the accounting and auditing \\\\nprofession, the Antitrust Law, Compet ition Law and the Monopoly Prevention \\\\nLaw. In addition, it is necessary to acceler ate and start the activ ities of the dispute \\\\nsettlement and arbitration center and to es tablish specialized j udicial circuits for \\\\ncases concerning the capital market. \\\\n\\\\x83 Raising the efficiency of the supervis ory, monitoring and judicial bodies, and \\\\nestablishing specialized circuits for courts concerned with capital market lawsuits, and improving the skills of the employees ar e basic elements for strict supervision \\\\nof the capital market and for promoting corporate governance. \\\\nIn conclusion, we cannot overemphasize the importance of increasing public \\\\nawareness and the culture of corporate govern ance among traders. Equally important is \\\\nmaking the self-regulatory organizations and co mpanies that issue securities aware of the \\\\nvital role activating corporate governan ce plays in the growth and sustainable \\\\ndevelopment of companies. \\\\n \\\\n41 \\\\n--- Page 45 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n42  \\\\n \\\\n           \\\\nAnnexes  \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 46 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nAnnex No. 1: Development of Stock Exchange Activity from January 1992 to December 2002 \\\\n \\\\n 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 \\\\nAnnual trading value (LE million)            \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 3.714 2.749 12.140 22.942 87.692 202.824 185.006 328.510 417.446 246.580 258.69 \\\\n Non-listed shares and bonds 225.3 293.7 1343.2 1555.2 2198.4 3937.4 4863.4 6235.1 7749.1 7016.4 8371.0 \\\\nAverage monthly trading value (LE \\\\nmillion)             \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 30.9 22.9 101.2 191.2 730.8 1690.2 1541.7 2737.6 3778.7 2054.8 2150.6 \\\\n Non-listed shares and bonds 18.8 24.5 111.9 129.6 183.2 328.1 405.3 519.6 645.8 584.7 698.4 \\\\nListed and trade shares and bonds (million)            \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 207 137 293 437 1.705 2.867 4.403 8.411 9.515 11.838 7.072 \\\\n Non listed shares and bonds 8.9 4.0 30.5 28.5 37.2 85.8 130.5 233.0 79.0 76.0 196.9 \\\\nNo. of operations            \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 11648 11184 51862 260964 2279521 1142510 672649 892291 1276216 1142410 739631 \\\\n Non-listed shares and bonds 855 750 42880 208651 36843 82841 14564 12909 10154 5521 94055 \\\\nNo. of companies listed and traded during \\\\nthe year 239 264 300 352 354 416 551 663 659 634 574 \\\\nAverage of companies with traded \\\\nsecurities during the month 78 84 91 113 129 168 218 243 232 218 210 \\\\nNo. of listed companies at the end of the \\\\nyear 656 674 700 746 646 650 861 1.033 1.076 1.110 1.150 \\\\nNo. of listed shares at the end of the year \\\\n(million) 405.7 424.0 451.0 1116.7 1387.9 1854.2 3354 4393 4672.8 5473.2 5605.7 \\\\nNominal share capital for listed companies (LE million) 8098 8890 8051 11052 13673 18291 33836 47077 74638 83020 92030 \\\\nMarket share capital for listed companies \\\\n(LE million) 10.845 12.807 14.480 27.420 48.086 70.873 83.140 112.331 119.778 111.333 122.014 \\\\nMarket share capital / nominal share \\\\ncapital 1.3 1.4 1.8 2.5 3.5 3.9 3.0 3.1 2.0 2.0 2.0 \\\\n \\\\nSource : CMA’s Information Center.  \\\\n43 \\\\n--- Page 47 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n44  \\\\nAnnex No. 2: Summary of the Development of Corporate Governance Criteria in Egypt from September 2001* to March 2002**  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nCriteria \\\\n No. of \\\\nCriteria for \\\\nEach \\\\nPrinciple  Assessment \\\\nCompletely \\\\nObserved Considerably \\\\nObserved Slightly Observed Not Observed \\\\n2001 2003 2001 2003 2001 2003 2001 2003 \\\\n1.

Competition also contributes to \\\\nincentivizing innovation and cost reductions, \\\\nwhich in turn shall bene/f_it the national economy, \\\\nand will achieve optimal economic eﬃciency.\\\\nIn this context, Law No. 3 of 2005 on Competition \\\\nProtection and Prevention of Monopolistic \\\\nPractices (\\\"Egyptian Competition Law\\\" or \\\"ECL\\\") \\\\nwas promulgated to ensure the freedom of \\\\ncompetition and achieve economic eﬃciency as \\\\nwell as competitive neutrality. ECL also states the \\\\nestablishment of the Egyptian Competition \\\\nAuthority (the “Egyptian Competition Authority” \\\\nor “ECA”). ECA is an independent body established \\\\nin 2006, to monitor markets and detect violations \\\\nto ECL. ECA’s role is to ensure free competition in \\\\nmarkets and prevent anticompetitive practices in \\\\na manner that ensures producer and consumer \\\\nwelfare, while strengthening the eﬃciency of the \\\\nnational economy.\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nECA emphasizes on creating and developing awareness of the principles of free competition, as well as \\\\ncreating a clear understanding of the provisions and rules stipulated by ECL. The dissemination and \\\\npromotion of awareness of ECL’s provisions and the competition culture are optimal ways to promote and \\\\nadvocate competition policies. For this reason, ECA has published this Compliance Toolkit, with the aim of \\\\nspreading competition culture and raising awareness on the bene/f_its of complying with ECL. This Toolkit \\\\naims at enhancing compliance of all undertakings engaged in any economic activity according to the \\\\nprovisions of ECL, by guiding them to avoid anticompetitive practices and to design their own legal \\\\ncompliance programs.Promoting\\\\nCompetitionBetter\\\\nPrices \\\\nHigher\\\\nQualityConsumer\\\\nWelfare\\\\n Economic\\\\nWelfare\\\\nfor ProducersEconomic\\\\nEﬃciency\\\\nStrengthening\\\\nNational\\\\nEconomy\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n3Who are the persons subject to\\\\nECL provisions?\\\\nArticle 2(a) ECL identi/f_ies the persons subject to ECL as: “Natural and juristic persons, economic entities, \\\\nunions, /f_inancial associations and consortiums, groups of persons notwithstanding their means of \\\\nincorporation, and related parties. ” In general, all natural and juristic persons that are engaged in economic \\\\nactivities are subject to ECL, this includes:\\\\nArticle 5 of ECL states: “The provisions of this Law shall apply to acts committed abroad should these acts \\\\nresult in the prevention, restriction or harm of the freedom of competition in Egypt and which constitute \\\\ncrimes under this Law” . ECL is applicable to practices committed by persons outside Egypt if such practices \\\\nrestrict competition within the Egyptian market. \\\\nAll types of companies, such as shareholders \\\\ncompanies, joint liability companies, limited \\\\npartnership companies, joint stock companies \\\\nwith shares and limited liability companies, as \\\\nwell as holding and aﬃliated companies.\\\\nAll companies notwithstanding their methods \\\\nof incorporation, /f_inancing, nationalities, \\\\nheadquarters location, or the main location of \\\\ntheir businesses.\\\\nTrade associations in which the aforementioned \\\\ncompanies participate.\\\\nNatural persons engaging in any economic \\\\nactivity, such as various liberal professions.\\\\nAll unions and syndicates.  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n4\\\\nDISSEMINATING\\\\nCOMPETITION CUL TURE\\\\nDETECT ANTI-COMPETITIVE\\\\nPRACTICES\\\\nRESPECTABLE\\\\nREPUTATION\\\\nAVOID COURT DECISIONS\\\\nAND FINANCIAL PENAL TIES\\\\nPROMOTING INVESTMENTWhat are\\\\nthe bene/f_its of complying with ECL?\\\\nDisseminating competition culture \\\\nwill encourage a greater number of \\\\nconcerned parties, such as \\\\ngovernment agencies, the business \\\\ncommunity and other stakeholders, \\\\nto avoid issuing decisions that do not \\\\nfollow competition policies or avoid \\\\nengaging in any anticompetitive  \\\\npractices. \\\\nPersons that are aware of ECL’s \\\\nprovisions would not engage in \\\\nprohibited anti-competitve practices. \\\\nHence, avoiding court decisions \\\\nimposing /f_inancial penalties for \\\\ninfringing ECL.\\\\nReducing barriers to entry and \\\\nensuring competitive neutrality, \\\\nsupports and encourages foreign and \\\\nlocal investors to enter and expand in \\\\nthe maket.\\\\nCompliance with ECL provisions \\\\neﬀectively leads to improving the \\\\npersons respectable reputation while \\\\nincreasing the competitiveness index \\\\nand compliance with ECL.\\\\nDisseminating awareness of ECL assists ECA in \\\\ndetecting various anticompetitive practices. \\\\nThis leads to safeguarding diﬀerent markets \\\\nand supporting a free market policy based on \\\\nsupply and demand. \\\\n\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\n5Practices prohibited by ECL are considered \\\\noﬀences punishable by criminal penalties. ECA \\\\nChairperson, upon approval of the majority of \\\\nthe Board members, may request the initiation \\\\nof criminal proceedings, pursuant to the \\\\nprovisions of Article 21 of ECL, which states: \\\\n“The criminal lawsuit or any procedure taken \\\\ntherein shall not be initiated, in relation to acts \\\\nviolating the provisions of this Law, unless a \\\\nwritten request of the Chairperson of the \\\\nAuthority is submitted upon the consent of the \\\\nmajority of the of its Board members. ” . \\\\nEconomic courts have the jurisdiction for \\\\nimposing penalties in relation to ECL oﬀences. Article 25 of ECL states that such a penalty is \\\\npersonal, as the person responsible for the \\\\nactual management of the juristic person shall \\\\nbe subject to the penalties stipulated for the \\\\nacts committed in violation of the provisions of \\\\nECL. The juristic person shall be jointly liable for \\\\npaying the /f_inancial penalties and \\\\ncompensation ruled by the court, if the breach \\\\nhas been committed by one of its employees \\\\nacting in the name of or on behalf of the juristic \\\\nperson.\\\\nIt is worth noting that ECA can settle \\\\nconcerning any infringements in accordance \\\\nto the provisions of Article 21 ECL. This shall be, \\\\nafter the approval of the majority of the Board \\\\nmembers and before a /f_inal ruling is issued by \\\\nthe relevant court. The settlement shall also be \\\\nconsidered a waiver of the request to initiate a \\\\ncriminal case, and results in the lapse of the \\\\ncriminal case. I\\\\nI: What are the anticompetitive\\\\npractices according to ECL?\\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\n6Anticompetitive practices as per ECL \\\\nare as follows:\\\\nArticle Article7\\\\n19Horizontal Agreements Vertical agreements\\\\nArticle Article\\\\nAbuse of Dominant Position Failure to notify\\\\nEconomic\\\\nConcentrations to ECA6\\\\n8\\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\nHorizontal agreements - also known as cartels - \\\\nare agreements between (current or potential) \\\\ncompetitors in the same relevant market, \\\\nincluding, but not limited to, agreements on \\\\n/f_ixing prices; allocating geographic areas, \\\\ncustomers, quantities; limiting product \\\\navailability;  or bid-rigging.\\\\nHorizontal agreements are among the most \\\\nharmful competition oﬀences. Competitors \\\\nshould make their decisions individually \\\\nwithout any form of coordination or \\\\nagreement between one another. This is in line \\\\nwith the principles of a free market economy, \\\\nwhich assume that markets function based on \\\\nsupply and demand mechanisms without the \\\\nin/f_luence of any other entities.Accordingly, these practices are considered per \\\\nse, or by object violations; which by their \\\\nnature cause restriction of competition. This \\\\nmeans that it is not necessary to prove the \\\\nexecution of the agreement or its \\\\nanti-competitive eﬀect.  Such agreements lead \\\\nto increased prices and loss of incentive for \\\\ncompanies to reduce costs or innovate, \\\\nreducing social and consumer welfare and \\\\nleading to distribution ineﬃciency.\\\\n7Horizontal Agreements: \\\\nArticle 6 para.1 of ECL\\\\nHorizontal and\\\\nVertical Relationships1\\\\nHorizontal Relationship\\\\nSupplier\\\\nService ProviderSupplierVertical Relationship\\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\n8Article 6 para.1 ECL explicitly prohibits competitors from entering into anti-competitive horizontal \\\\nagreements. It also outlines the types of agreements which are prohibited for competitors. \\\\nArticle 6 states: “Agreements or contracts between competing persons, in any relevant market, are \\\\nprohibited, if they cause any of the following:Article 6: Horizontal Agreements \\\\na) Increase, decrease or /f_ix prices \\\\nof relevant products\\\\nc) Coordinating with regard to \\\\nproceeding or refraining from \\\\nparticipating in tenders, auctions, \\\\nnegotiations and other calls for \\\\nprocurement.d) Restricting processes of \\\\nmanufacturing, production, \\\\ndistribution, or marketing of \\\\nproducts. This includes \\\\nrestricting product type or \\\\nvolume or limiting the \\\\navailability thereof. ”b) Divide product markets or \\\\nallocate based on geographical \\\\nareas, distribution centers, type of \\\\ncustomers, type of goods, market \\\\nshares, seasons or periods of time. \\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\nHorizontal agreements have been de/f_ined by \\\\nthe Egyptian courts as “the concurrence of wills \\\\nof two or more persons who are considered by \\\\nlaw to be competing persons on any act \\\\nrelated to their economic activity, with the \\\\nintention of restricting or limiting competition \\\\nin the market in which they operate, whether \\\\nthe agreement is written or verbal, or whether \\\\nit is based on an active or passive act. ”\\\\nAgreements in the context of ECL do not \\\\nnecessarily have to be contracts that create \\\\nlegal eﬀects and obligations. Horizontal \\\\nagreements can take many forms such as \\\\ngentlemen\\\\'s agreement or contracts.\\\\nAgreements violating Article 6 do not necessarily \\\\nhave to be explicit and clear agreements on \\\\nincreasing, decreasing or /f_ixing prices, restricting \\\\ndistribution or production, dividing markets, or \\\\nbid-rigging. It is suﬃcient that the agreement is \\\\nlikely to cause any of the mentioned eﬀects \\\\nbased on the content of the agreement and its \\\\ncircumstances.

The exchange of sensitive information is a type of \\\\nagreement between competitors that may signi/f_icantly restrict competition and, \\\\nconsequently, may constitute a violation to Article 6 ECL. \\\\nTherefore, competitors should be careful when exchanging information to avoid \\\\ninfringing Article (6) ECL.\\\\n12\\\\n--- Page 17 ---\\\\n13Article (22) of ECL stipulates that violations of Article 6 shall be punished by: “a /f_ine of not less than two \\\\npercent of the gross revenues of the product subject matter of the violation, and not exceeding twelve \\\\npercent of the aforementioned gross revenues, within the violation period. In case of the inability of \\\\ncalculating the aforementioned revenues, the penalty shall be a /f_ine of not less than /f_ive hundred \\\\nthousand Egyptian Pounds, and not exceeding /f_ive hundred million Egyptian Pounds.\\\\nThe minimum and maximum limits of the /f_ine shall be doubled, in case of recidivism for violating the \\\\nprovisions of any of the Articles 6, 7, 8 of this Law, and in case of failure to comply with the decisions \\\\nadopted by the Authority in accordance with Article 20 of this Law\\\" .\\\\nExample of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Articles 6(a) and 6(d) ECL\\\\nExample of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Article 6(c) ECL\\\\nECA received a request from the Minister of \\\\nTrade and Industry to study whether there are \\\\nany agreements or anticompetitive practices \\\\nin the cement sector in Egypt.\\\\nDuring the study period (which starts at the \\\\ndate of the entry into force of ECL on 16 May \\\\n2005), the study conducted by ECA concluded \\\\nthat the cement production companies \\\\nagreed to increase prices in violation of \\\\nArticle 6(a) ECL. ECA also detected a violation \\\\nof Article 6(d) ECL, as these companies agreed \\\\nto restrict marketing in the relevant market by \\\\nallocating market shares in the Egyptian \\\\nmarket.\\\\nIn addition, the Nasr City First Misdemeanors \\\\nCourt ruled that all the companies were \\\\npunished with a /f_ine of EGP 200 million.ECA initiated a study on the public procurement \\\\nmarket for medical supplies of cardiothoracic \\\\nsurgery. ECA received information regarding \\\\nthe suspected coordination between several \\\\nbidders in this market in violation of Article 6 \\\\nECL. \\\\nECA conducted dawn raids on the premises of \\\\nrelevant companies under investigation, and \\\\ngathered data and documents from the \\\\nrelevant authorities and other sources. Based on \\\\nthe legal and economic analysis of all the infor-\\\\nmation and data gathered throughout the \\\\ninvestigation, ECA detected that the companies \\\\nhad coordinated to submit identical price oﬀers. \\\\nAiming to take advantage of Article 68 of the \\\\nExecutive Regulations of Public procurement \\\\nLaw No. 89 of 1998, which allows for awarding \\\\nthe bidders who have submitted identical oﬀers \\\\nthe entire volume of products to be equally \\\\nshared amongst them.\\\\nTherefore, ECA’s Board of Directors concluded \\\\nthat there had been a violation of Article 6(c) \\\\nECL and referred the matter to the public prose-\\\\ncution. The Economic Court issued a ruling \\\\nwhereby it imposed a /f_ine of EGP 500 million to \\\\nbe paid by the companies. What is the penalty\\\\nforviolating Article 6?\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\n14\\\\nAn example of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Article 6(d)\\\\nAn example of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Articles 6(b) and 6(d)ECA received a complaint against two Pharma-\\\\nceutical companies, alleging that the compa-\\\\nnies had agreed to bundle two separate prod-\\\\nucts. The agreement was that two medications \\\\nwhich they both produce for the treatment of \\\\nHepatitis C Virus, namely Daclatasvir and \\\\nSofosbuvir, should only be sold together as a \\\\nbundle. This agreement would force Egyptian \\\\npatients to buy speci/f_ic medications and \\\\nwould restrict the competitiveness of compa-\\\\nnies producing only Sofosbuvir. \\\\nECA’s Board of Directors decided that the two \\\\ncompanies had violated Article 6(d) ECL for \\\\ntheir agreement to restrict the distribution of \\\\nSofosbuvir and Daclatasvir by agreeing to \\\\nbundle them together. The Board also ordered \\\\nboth companies to individually set the prices \\\\nof their products and take the marketing \\\\ndecisions without coordination or exchanging \\\\nof con/f_idential and sensitive information with \\\\nany of their competitors.\\\\nThe two companies submitted a request to \\\\nsettle with ECA before initiating the criminal \\\\nproceedings. ECA accepted the settlement \\\\nrequest and the payment of the prescribed \\\\nsettlement amount pursuant to the provisions \\\\nof Article 21(a) ECL.ECA initiated an investigation following the \\\\nsudden exit of an online delivery company \\\\nfrom the Egyptian market. Raising the possibil-\\\\nity of the occurrence of an anticompetitive \\\\npractice in violation of ECL.\\\\nBased on the investigation, ECA established \\\\nthat the company’s exit from the Egyptian \\\\nmarket resulted from a market allocation \\\\nhorizontal agreement made in one of the Euro-\\\\npean countries between the two parent com-\\\\npanies of the two largest online delivery com-\\\\npanies in the Egyptian market in violation of \\\\nArticle 6 ECL. Market allocation on a geograph-\\\\nical basis between competitors is one of the \\\\nmost harmful anticompetitive practices, as it \\\\nfalls out of natural competition that gives \\\\nconsumers the freedom of choice between \\\\nproducts and ensures competitive prices and \\\\nbetter quality.\\\\nAccordingly, ECA Board of Directors issued its \\\\ndecision that the two parent companies had \\\\ninfringed Articles 6(b) and 6(d) ECL. ECA \\\\nordered the companies to immediately cease \\\\nthe implementation of the anticompetitive \\\\nagreement, to restore the situation to what it \\\\nwas before the conclusion of these agree-\\\\nments, and for the company that had exited \\\\nthe Egyptian market to re-operate. The two \\\\ncompanies have complied with ECA\\\\'s decision.\\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\n15In order to avoid the penalties of horizontal agreements, competitors must make decisions individually. \\\\nThis is in alignment with principles of free market economy that assumes that competition among \\\\nundertakings should be based only on supply and demand mechanisms, without any in/f_luence from third \\\\nparties.  \\\\nHow to comply with\\\\nthe provisions of Article 6 ECL? \\\\n1.Regarding the independence\\\\nof decision-making,\\\\nundertakings should:\\\\nMake decisions independently with regard to \\\\npricing, production and sales strategies, and \\\\nanything related to customers or suppliers.\\\\nAvoid coordination with competitors on \\\\nallocating markets, customers, or products.\\\\nAvoid coordination with competitors on \\\\nrestricting manufacturing, production, distri-\\\\nbution, or marketing of products, or restricting \\\\nthe type or size of products or limiting their \\\\navailability\\\\n2.

RPM is one of the vertical agreements \\\\nthat may harm competition, because it \\\\nrestricts intra-brand competition. It may also \\\\nresult in the coordination of prices among \\\\ndistributors (who are considered competitors) \\\\nespecially when setting minimum or /f_ixed \\\\nprices. Resale price maintenance\\\\nExclusive distribution agreements occur \\\\nwhen a supplier agrees with a distributor to \\\\nsell the suppliers products exclusively, or \\\\nagrees with the distributor to work exclusively \\\\nwith the supplier in certain geographic areas, \\\\ndistribution centers, customers; seasons or \\\\nperiods.Exclusive distribution agreementsThe most favored nation clauses (MFN \\\\nclauses) are anticompetitive vertical \\\\nagreements where one party cannot provide \\\\nproducts at prices better than those oﬀered \\\\nby the other party. For example, a distributor \\\\nmay require a supplier not to sell products at \\\\na better price to other distributors, which will \\\\nlead to the distributors\\\\' inability to provide \\\\nthe product at better prices; hence reducing \\\\ncompetition and raising prices for consumers.Most Favored Nation Clauses\\\\nSingle branding occurs when a supplier \\\\nagrees with a distributer to buy and distribute \\\\ntheir product exclusively. Single Branding\\\\n26\\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\n27Active sales occur when a distributor in a \\\\ndesignated geographical area seeks to attract \\\\nconsumers located in another geographical \\\\narea in an explicit and direct manner. For \\\\nexample, this is accomplished through \\\\nadvertisements or solicited discounts. \\\\nGenerally, the restriction of active sales is not \\\\na violation of Article 7 ECL.Restricting active sales\\\\nPassive sales, or unsolicited sales, mean that a \\\\ndistributor in a designated geographical area \\\\nful/f_ills orders from consumers in other \\\\ngeographical areas without seeking to attract \\\\nthem in an explicit and direct manner. Online \\\\nsales are a form of passive sales. Generally, the \\\\nrestriction of passive sales is a violation of \\\\nArticle 7 ECL, as it limits the consumer’s \\\\nfreedom of choice between the best products \\\\nat the best prices.\\\\nArticle 22 of ECL stipulates that violations of Articles 7 shall be punished by: “a /f_ine of not less than one \\\\npercent of the gross revenues of the product subject matter of the violation, and not exceeding ten \\\\npercent of the aforementioned revenues, within the violation period. In case of the inability of calculat-\\\\ning the aforementioned revenues, the penalty shall be a /f_ine of not less than one hundred thousand \\\\nEgyptian Pounds, and not exceeding three hundred million Egyptian Pounds.\\\\nThe minimum and maximum limits of the /f_ine shall be doubled, in case of recidivism for violating the \\\\nprovisions of any of the Articles 6, 7, 8 of this Law, and in case of failure to comply with the decisions \\\\nadopted by the Authority in accordance with Article 20 of this Law. ”What is the penalty for violating Article 7 ECL?Restricting passive sales\\\\nECA received a complaint alleging that a photography studio is the sole and exclusive studio that can \\\\nprovide photography and video recording services for wedding events in luxury hotels in Alexandria \\\\ngovernorate. \\\\nECA established that the relevant product market is the photography services of wedding events in \\\\n/f_ive-star hotels or in similar establishments, and that the geographic area is Alexandria governorate.\\\\nBased on the legal and economic analysis from the information and data obtained by ECA, it was found \\\\nthat the studio’s agreements with the hotels violates article 7 ECL. ECA concluded that such agreements \\\\nwould restrict the freedom of competition and restrict consumer choice in terms of the availability of \\\\nservices and their prices. In particular, during meetings conducted with market players, it was found that \\\\nsuch agreements negatively aﬀected market players in the relevant market and led to the exit of some \\\\nstudios from the market, as they were being unable to provide their services in the aforementioned \\\\nhotels because of the contractual conditions upon requiring changing the photographer.

The /f_irst step to follow is \\\\nresearching and identifying the areas of the \\\\ncompany’s business that are prone to \\\\nanticompetitive practices.\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed: \\\\n- Studying and reviewing the behavior of the company \\\\nand its employees □ Are there any employees \\\\nwho are likely to be in contact with competitors \\\\nas a result of the nature of their work? Are there \\\\nmechanisms that facilitate the process of \\\\nagreement with competitors (especially regarding \\\\nmeetings in trade associations or regarding \\\\npublic procurement)?\\\\n- Studying and reviewing any existing or potential \\\\nagreements □ Are there any agreements between \\\\nthe company and its competitors or suppliers \\\\nthat may violate the provisions of articles 6, 7, or \\\\n8 ECL?Risk Assessment Calculate your risks\\\\n51Second Step: Analyze the risks\\\\nAfter identifying the risks, the company must \\\\nanalyze and evaluate the risks and rank such \\\\nrisks according to the degree of harm to \\\\ncompetition in the market.\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed:\\\\n- Appoint an oﬃcer responsible for \\\\ncompliance to ECL provisions to analyze \\\\nthe risks and follow steps three and four. \\\\nThird Step: Manage the risks\\\\nOnce the risks have been assessed and ranked, \\\\nthe next step is to develop the necessary \\\\npolicies and procedures to mitigate and \\\\naddress them.\\\\n--- Page 56 ---\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed:\\\\n- Train and educate employees on the \\\\nimportance of compliance with ECL, as \\\\nwell as how to avoid any anticompetitive \\\\npractices (this should include, in particular, \\\\nemployees who attend meetings of trade \\\\nassociations, and those involved in public \\\\nprocurement).\\\\n- Take action to cease any practices that \\\\npotentially violate the provisions of ECL.Fourth Step: Monitor the risks\\\\nUndertakings should review the previous steps \\\\non a regular basis in order to ensure that no \\\\nnew risks arise that may harm competition.\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed:\\\\n- Reviewing the behavior of the company \\\\nand its employees on an annual basis\\\\n- Reviewing the existing or potential agree-\\\\nments on an annual basis\\\\n- Training employees repeatedly on an \\\\nannual basis, as well as training newly \\\\nhired employees.\\\\n52\\\\n--- Page 57 ---\\\\nFor inquiries\\\\nPlease contact ECA using the following \\\\nTel: 02-35351900\\\\nFax: 02-35370436\\\\nE-mail: info@eca.org.eg\\\\nAddress: B19, Smart Village, Kilo 28 Alex Desert Road\\\\nFor more information on ECA and for more publications, please \\\\nvisit ECA’s website\\\\n http://www.eca.org.eg\\\\n--- Page 58 ---\\\\nT: (202) 3535 1900     F: (202) 3537 0436\\\\nwww.eca.org.egBuilding B19,1st /f_loor, Smart Village, KM 28 Cairo - Alexandria Desert Road\\\\n    content_length: 64692\\\\n    word_count: 9750\\\\n    processing_timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:41:10.250187\\\\n    status: success\\\\n\\\\n  -     filename: Lexology-In-Depth-Corporate-Governance-Corporate-Governance_-Egypt.pdf\\\\n    filepath: C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\amros\\\\\\\\Downloads\\\\\\\\iVolution\\\\\\\\data\\\\\\\\Lexology-In-Depth-Corporate-Governance-Corporate-Governance_-Egypt.pdf\\\\n    file_extension: .pdf\\\\n    mime_type: application/pdf\\\\n    metadata:       size_bytes: 203113\\\\n      created_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:15.559394\\\\n      modified_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:16.003032\\\\n      file_hash: 90175c33902864819152acfdf6d9958b6bb09a32d7018ce098fe41edbffd505f\\\\n\\\\n    content: --- Page 1 ---\\\\nIN-DEPTH\\\\nCorporate \\\\nGovernance\\\\nEGYPT\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 2 ---\\\\nCorporate Governance\\\\nEDITION 15\\\\nContributing Editor\\\\nWill Pearce\\\\nDavis Polk & Wardwell LLP\\\\nIn-Depth: Corporate Governance  (formerly The Corporate Governance Review) is a useful \\\\noverview of the corporate governance regimes in key jurisdictions worldwide.

However, additional laws and \\\\nregulations could be applied based on, for example, the activity and listing status of the \\\\nrelevant company. These laws and regulations include, for example:\\\\n1.Investment Law No.72 of 2017 (the Investment Law) and its executive regulations;\\\\n2.Capital Market Law No.95 of 1992 and its executive regulations;\\\\n3.Governance Rules for Non-Banking Financial Activities No.100 of 2020 (the \\\\nGovernance Rules);\\\\n4.the General Authority for Investments and Free Zones (GAFI) circulars and guides;\\\\n5.the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) circulars and guides; and\\\\n6.the Listing and Delisting Rules No.11 of 2014 (the Listing Rules).\\\\nGAFI and FRA are mainly empowered to oversee companies and regulate the corporate \\\\ngovernance framework. It is important to highlight that FRA, along with the Egyptian \\\\nExchange (EGX), primarily enforces and monitors the regime for listed companies.\\\\nGAFI has been working hard for years to simplify the corporate governance process, \\\\nespecially after the covid-19 pandemic and the overarching state policy for improving \\\\nthe overall regulatory framework as part of the improvement initiatives for foreign direct \\\\ninvestment (FDI) in Egypt. As an example, GAFI allowed corporate bodies\\\\' meetings to be \\\\nheld online including, inter alia, ordinary general assembly meetings (OGMs), extraordinary \\\\ngeneral assembly meetings (EGMs) and board of directors meetings. Furthermore, GAFI \\\\nstarted to minimise the number of documents required for the purpose of reviewing and \\\\ncertifying the minutes of the meetings as highlighted below.\\\\nIt is worth nothing that incorporated companies (i.e., corporations) in Egypt may take the \\\\nform of joint stock company (JSC), limited liability company (LLC), limited partnership by \\\\nshares company (LPSC) and sole person company (SPC).\\\\nIn this chapter, we shed light on the regulation of JSCs, this being the standard process \\\\nthat shall, in general, apply to LLCs, LLCs, LPSCs and SPCs unless otherwise required by \\\\nlaw.\\\\nYear in review\\\\nDuring the past year, the corporate governance regime witnessed key developments and \\\\nimprovement milestones including, for example, the issuance by GAFI of several decrees \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nreducing the number of documents required by over 62 per cent. This streamlining aims \\\\nto ease procedures for all investors and business owners.\\\\nCorporate leadership\\\\nThe legal system in Egypt does not recognise the two-tier board of directors structure. Only \\\\nthe one-tier board system is recognised.\\\\nA JSC is, as a general rule, required to be managed by a board comprising at least three \\\\nmembers to be elected by the General Assembly for a term of three years, as speci’ed in \\\\nthe companyWs articles of association (AoA). A board meeting is generally considered valid \\\\nif attended by at least three members, unless the AoA requires a larger quorum.\\\\nIt is worth noting that there are other rules that apply to certain activities (such as \\\\nnon-banking ’nancial institutions and banks) and publicly listed JSCs. For example, for \\\\nJSCs engaged in non-banking ’nancial activities, the board must, in general, have a \\\\nmajority of non-executive directors, with at least half of these being independent directors. \\\\nAdditionally, these companies are required to have at least one female director on their \\\\nboard.\\\\nMoreover, it is also worth noting that a minimum of two female board directors is required \\\\nto be represented in listed companies, where at least 25 per cent of the total board \\\\nmembership needs to be women.\\\\nThe board must appoint a chair from among its members and may also designate a vice \\\\nchair. The vice chair acts on the chair\\\\'s behalf in the chair\\\\'s absence, and the board may \\\\nalso delegate one or more of its members for conducting a speci’ed activity or having a \\\\nspeci’ed duty and exercising some of the designated duties of the board.\\\\nFurthermore, the board may, as a general rule, grant the chair the authority of a managing \\\\ndirector for JSCs that are not publicly listed. JSCs shall be represented in court by either \\\\nthe chair or the chief executive oUcer (CEO), in accordance with the companyWs AoA.\\\\nThe board is generally required to, inter alia:\\\\n1.undertake all the duties arising from the business of the company they manage, and \\\\nact for its best interest;\\\\n2.convene the board meetings and call for the OGMs and EGMs;\\\\n3.prepare ’nancial statements and report on the companyWs activities and ’nancial \\\\nstatus; and\\\\n4.submit all the mandatory key declarations on behalf of the company and maintain \\\\nthe companyWs commercial ledgers and mandatory registers.\\\\n•ith regard to the chairWs control over the board, it is necessary to note that the chairWs \\\\nrole includes, inter alia: (1) representing the company before courts; (2) calling the board \\\\nmeetings to convene; (3) calling the OGM and EGM general assembly meetings to convene; \\\\nand (4) performing whatever roles are designated to the chair by the AoA. Moreover, the \\\\nchair is generally empowered to sign and conclude transactions on behalf of the company, \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nand any other authorised members of the board, unless decided otherwise by the general \\\\nassembly.\\\\nThe delegation of powers from the chair to the vice chair is addressed in the Companies \\\\nLaw, which states that the vice chair replaces the chair in their absence and notes that \\\\nappointing a vice chair is not mandatory. The board may also delegate one of its members \\\\nfor conducting a speci’ed activity or more or having speci’ed duty and exercise some of \\\\nthe designated duties of the board.\\\\nThe separation of roles between the chair and the CEO is determined by the responsibilities \\\\nand competencies speci’ed in the company\\\\'s AoA. It is also important to highlight that \\\\nthere are distinct differences between the roles of the chair and the CEO. Speci’cally, the \\\\nCEO does not have the authority to call for the board of directors meetings or OGMs.\\\\nMoreover, it is prohibited for listed companies and companies undertaking non-’nancial \\\\nbanking activities to combine the position of the chair and the CEO.\\\\nThe managing director and members of the board of directors are entitled to remuneration; \\\\nhowever, the OGM is, in general, the corporate body that determines lump sum payments, \\\\nattendance allowances and other bene’ts prescribed for members of the board of \\\\ndirectors.\\\\nThe board committees are given a de’nition under the Companies Law as committees \\\\nformed by the members of the board (the non-executive and independent members) \\\\nfor organisational purposes through distributing certain work between its members. It \\\\nmay also authorise one of its members or a committee to carry out speci’c job, or to \\\\nsupervise an area of the companyWs activity, or to exercise some of the powers or functions \\\\nassigned to the board. Moreover, the Governance Rules introduced several types of board \\\\ncommittees, including, inter alia, the audit committee, the remuneration committee, the \\\\nnomination committee, the risk management committee and the governance committee. \\\\n•e would like to emphasise that the main responsibility of the committees is limited to \\\\nsubmitting recommendations to the board, which is the decision-making authority; the \\\\nboard can amend the recommendations and revoke the committees.\\\\nIt is important to highlight that, with regard to the non-banking ’nancial activities, related \\\\ncompanies are obliged to establish an audit committee and in some cases the companies \\\\nare obliged to establish a governance committee as well.\\\\n•ith regard to the board role in share issuance, the board may increase the issued capital \\\\nof the company within the authorised capital by virtue of a resolution of the boardWs \\\\nmeeting. This authorised capital is deemed a pre-authorisation by the shareholders to the \\\\nboard to increase the issued capital within a speci’c limit, which should not exceed 10 \\\\ntimes of the issued capital. This pre-authorisation needs to be used within a speci’c time \\\\nframe and is considered an exceptional process from the main process that needs to be \\\\nfollowed for obtaining the shareholdersW approval.\\\\nThe AoA may require obtaining the prior approval of the board before the transfer of \\\\nshares, and in the event the board rejects the transfer of shares, the board may purchase \\\\nthese provided that they do not exceed 10 per cent of the total issued shares of the \\\\ncompany. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that within one year of the purchase date \\\\nthe company must: (1) transfer the shares to a third party; (2) distribute the purchased \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nshares to all the shareholders of the company as free shares; or (3) decrease the issued \\\\ncapital of the company by the amount of nominal value of the purchased shares.\\\\nThe Governance Rules de’ne an independent director as a non-executive director with \\\\nrelevant experience who is not aUliated with the company\\\\'s board, its senior management \\\\nor the parent company, and who does not hold an executive post in the company, and is \\\\nnot paid a monthly or annual salary, except compensation as a board member.\\\\nIn addition, this independent director is not a representative of the shareholders, and has \\\\nno material transactions with the company, and is not paid any salary, commission or fees, \\\\nexcept compensation as a board member. The independent director should neither have a \\\\npersonal interest in the company, nor be a relative by blood or marriage or otherwise up to \\\\nsecond degree relationship to any of its shareholders, board directors or executives. This \\\\nmember also should not be a senior oUcer, adviser or external auditor of the company \\\\nfor three years prior to their appointment. Importantly, their tenure of membership as an \\\\nindependent director should not exceed a maximum of six consecutive years, otherwise \\\\nthey will become a non-independent director.\\\\nThe general assembly may ’le a lawsuit against any director for any mistakes that have \\\\nnegatively impacted the company.\\\\nCon@icts of interest must be avoided by any board member, whereby any con@ict of interest \\\\nmatter must be reported to the board for approval. The relevant board member who has \\\\nthat con@ict of interest is prohibited from voting on a decision on that matter.\\\\nCorporate disclosure\\\\nOn 9 August 2023, the FRA issued a decision outlining the corporate governance rules \\\\napplicable to non-banking ’nancial activities companies.\\\\nThis decision presents a set of corporate governance rules, of which some regulate the \\\\ntransparency and disclosure requirements of non-banking ’nancial activities companies. \\\\nThese rules stipulate that non-banking ’nancial activities companies are required to:\\\\n1.disclose any material event that affects their activities and third parties dealing with \\\\nthe companies;\\\\n2.notify and provide the FRA with the key corporate structure information including the \\\\nshareholding structure for shareholders holding 5 per cent or more of the shareWs \\\\nthreshold, recent board structure, key employees structure, without prejudice to \\\\nnotifying the FRA with any amendment or modi’cation to the board structure or the \\\\nrelated internal board committees, and any convened OGMs within 10 days as of \\\\ntheir convocation, and any amendments made thereto;\\\\n3.provide the FRA with annual ’nancial statements, along with the auditorWs report \\\\nand the board of directors\\\\' report for review within 21 days of the convocation date \\\\nof the general meeting approving these ’nancial statements, and the non-banking \\\\n’nancial activities companies should comply with the applicable laws and refer the \\\\n’nancial statements to the general meeting for approval within a maximum period \\\\nof three months as of the end of the ’scal year. In addition, these companies are \\\\nrequired to submit quarterly ’nancial statements to the FRA, accompanied by a \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nlimited examination report from the auditor, within 45 days of the end of the period \\\\nfor which the ’nancial statements are submitted.\\\\nThe decision introduced an exception to the aforementioned disclosure requirements, \\\\nwhereby suspended companies are exempted from submitting the quarterly ’nancial \\\\nstatements throughout the suspension period.\\\\nFurthermore, the Listing Rules have also stipulated provisions regarding the corporate \\\\ndisclosure for companies listed on EGX as follows.\\\\n1.Each shareholder shall disclose to the EGX when exceeding or decreasing their \\\\nownership and associated parties to a ratio of 5 per cent and its multipliers from the \\\\nnumber of securities representing the company\\\\'s capital or voting rights, including \\\\nshares subscribed to by purchasing the underwriting rights, including disclosure \\\\nof the shareholder and its parties directly associated with the shares and foreign \\\\ndeposit certi’cates corresponding to the company\\\\'s shares as well as their indirect \\\\nownership through the ownership of 25 per cent or more of the capital of a company \\\\nor entity that in turn owns a ratio in the capital of the listed company to which this \\\\nshareholder contributes.\\\\n2.In addition to that, the shareholders referred to in the preceding point (a) are also \\\\nobliged to disclose the future investment plan and the shareholder\\\\'s directions \\\\nregarding the management of the company if the percentage purchased from it and \\\\nassociated parties is 25 per cent or more of the company\\\\'s capital or voting rights.\\\\n3.The provisions of the preceding points (a) and (b) apply to the members of the board \\\\nof the listed company and its employees and related parties upon completion of the \\\\nsale or purchase of one of the 3 per cent or multipliers of the company\\\\'s securities.\\\\nIt is also worth noting that, as per the amendments introduced by the Investment \\\\nLaw, any company in Egypt that has foreign direct or indirect investment contributions, \\\\nirrespective of its percentage, must comply with some speci’c reporting obligations \\\\nregarding corporate disclosure stipulated by the Executive Regulations of the Investment \\\\nLaw as follows:\\\\n1.the company shall submit an FDI report within 30 days of any changes to the \\\\ncompanyWs board structure, shareholder structure, capital or purpose;\\\\n2.the company shall submit the FDI report within 45 days of the end of each quarter \\\\n(i.e., the end of March, June, September and December); and\\\\n3.the FDI report must be submitted within four months of the ’scal yearWs end.\\\\nIn addition to that, according to a regulation issued in 2020 by the Minister of Supply and \\\\nInternal Trade, all companies must disclose the actual bene’ciaries also known as the \\\\nultimate bene’ciary owners (HBOs) who have a controlling interest or the actual control of \\\\nthe decision-making on the company and other information including the nationality and \\\\nID or passport numbers of the HBOs.\\\\nAccording to the Companies Law, the board is required to publish ’nancial statements, a \\\\ncomprehensive summary of its report and the full text of the auditorWs report prior to the \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\ngeneral assembly meeting, unless otherwise required by the AoA (such as sending the \\\\n’nancial statements directly to the shareholders).\\\\nA JSC is required to comply, inter alia, with the following audit requirements:\\\\n1.each JSC is required to appoint at least one auditor who shall be quali’ed to practise \\\\naccounting and auditing in Egypt, and where there is more than one auditor, the \\\\nappointed auditors shall be jointly liable towards the JSC; and\\\\n2.a JSC is required to allow the appointed auditor or auditors to: (1) access any \\\\ncompany ledger, books and documents; and (2) con’rm the existence of its \\\\ninventory as well as providing any required clari’cations or data.\\\\nEnvironmental, social and governance\\\\nIn July 2021, the FRA issued a Decree regulating the disclosure of environmental, social \\\\nand governance practices on sustainability and the ’nancial impacts of climate change by \\\\ncompanies engaged in non-bank ’nancial activities and companies listed on the Egyptian \\\\nExchange (EGX), requiring companies listed on the EGX, and companies operating in \\\\nnon-bank ’nancial activities to submit environmental, social and governance disclosure \\\\nreports related to sustainability. This Decree presents two levels of compliance as follows.\\\\nESG disclosure reports will be required from all companies whose securities are listed \\\\non the EGX in addition to companies operating in non-banking ’nancial activities whose \\\\nissued capital or net ownership rights are not less than 100 million Egyptian pounds.\\\\nCompanies whose issued capital or net ownership rights are not less than 500 million \\\\nEgyptian pounds and that are listed on the EGX and that are engaged in non-banking \\\\n’nancial activities will be required to complete disclosures concerning the ’nancial \\\\neffects of climate change in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial \\\\nDisclosures (TCFD), with their annual reports prepared by their board of directors and \\\\nattached to the annual ’nancial statements.\\\\nAs per the aforementioned Decrees, the report is submitted after ’lling out the attached \\\\nannual report forms to be completed and submitted to the FRA at the date of submission \\\\nof the ’nancial statements of the past ’scal year.\\\\nShareholders\\\\nThe Companies Law includes several provisions regarding the rights and powers of \\\\nshareholders in the participation and contribution of the company\\\\'s management. Each \\\\nshareholder has the right either personally or by proxy to attend, participate actively and \\\\nvote in OGMs or EGMs.\\\\nShareholders typically possess equal rights and obligations, including equal voting rights. \\\\nHowever, the AoA may grant speci’c privileges to certain classes of shares concerning \\\\nvoting, pro’t distribution and liquidation balances. It is important to note that voting \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nprivileges and liquidation balances are not combined. Additionally, shares of the same \\\\nclass must be treated equally in terms of advantages or restrictions.\\\\nThe shareholder has the right to request the board to convene the OGM where the number \\\\nof shareholders who want this own at least 5 per cent of the company\\\\'s capital. The \\\\nshareholder has the right to discuss the topics on the agenda of the general assembly and \\\\nto ask questions about them to the members of the board and the auditor. These questions \\\\nmust be answered to the extent that the company\\\\'s interests are not prejudiced.\\\\nAdditionally, the general assembly has the power at any time to remove and revoke the \\\\nboard or any of its members even if this is not mentioned in the agenda of the general \\\\nassembly meeting.\\\\nAs per the Companies Law, some decisions and actions must be taken by the approval of \\\\nthe shareholders upon the convening of an OGM or an EGM subject to their competencies \\\\nstipulated by the Law, including, but not limited to:\\\\n1.the election and removal of members of the board;\\\\n2.approving ’nancial statements;\\\\n3.distribution of dividends and the remuneration of the board;\\\\n4.liquidation of the company, amending rights, privileges and restrictions for types of \\\\nshares;\\\\n5.extending or shortening the term of the company;\\\\n6.resolving the company before its term;\\\\n7.changing  the  proportion  of  loss  that  results  in  the  company\\\\'s  compulsory \\\\ndissolution or incorporation;\\\\n8.approving the merger of the company;\\\\n9.increasing the companyWs issued capital by premium shares;\\\\n10.increasing the companyWs authorised capital;\\\\n11.reducing the capital of the company;\\\\n12.amending the AoA; and\\\\n13.considering the dissolution or continuation of the company, if the company\\\\'s losses \\\\nin one or more ’nancial years amount to half the value of shareholders\\\\' equity \\\\naccording to the latest approved annual ’nancial statements of the company.\\\\nThe Companies Law granted the dissenting shareholders who attended the general \\\\nassembly meetings, and the shareholders who did not attend the meeting for a valid \\\\nreason, the right to annul the resolutions issued in favour of speci’c shareholders. It \\\\nalso grants them the right to annul the resolutions issued that harm them, or that bring \\\\nspecial bene’t to members of the board or others without regard to the interests of the \\\\ncompany. Moreover, any resolutions of the general assembly issued in contravention to \\\\nthe provisions of the AoA will be void, in accordance with the Companies Law.\\\\nThe OGM is concerned with the approval of the management report prepared by the board \\\\nfor the companyWs activities during the ended ’scal year. In addition, the OGM also is tasked \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nwith the discharge of the members of the board from all their duties for the ended ’scal \\\\nyear.\\\\n•ith respect to the quorum of attendees at the OGM, as per the Companies Law, the OGM \\\\nshall be valid only if it is attended by shareholders representing at least one quarter of \\\\nthe capital unless the AoA provides for a higher percentage on condition that it does not \\\\nexceed half of the capital as a minimum.\\\\nDecisions of the general assembly shall be taken, as a general rule, by an absolute majority \\\\nof the number of votes of the shares of the shareholders represented at the meeting, unless \\\\nthe AoA require a higher percentage.\\\\nShareholders holding at least 5 per cent of capital shares can request the inclusion of \\\\nspeci’c topics to the agenda as to be discussed in the general assembly, which guarantees \\\\nthat minority shareholdersW voices and opinions are heard and taken into consideration.\\\\nIn addition to that, minority shareholders have access to information since minority \\\\nshareholders have the right to access the companyWs ’nancial statements, audit \\\\nreports and other important documents. This transparency ensures their inclusion in \\\\nthe company\\\\'s management and helps them to deliver informative opinions. Also, \\\\nshareholders having at least 10 per cent shares of the capital are eligible to request a \\\\n’nancial audit or investigation into suspicious acts of the company\\\\'s management.\\\\nAll related-party transactions must be disclosed and pre-approved by the general assembly, \\\\nin order to be monitored by minority shareholders that will have the right to vote on these \\\\ntransactions to ensure that they are not used to bene’t insiders at the expense of the \\\\ncompany and other shareholders. This grants them the opportunity to be aware of any \\\\nrestructuring happening within the company group that could affect them.\\\\nAoA may include some measures and regulations with respect to the transfer of shares (in \\\\nacquisitions). AoA may contain speci’c rules governing share trading, but may not remove \\\\nthe shareholder\\\\'s right to transfer their shares; share trading may include mandatory prior \\\\napproval of the companiesW management or approval from the board as the case may be.\\\\nIf the transfer of shares is subject to a right of ’rst refusal, then the following general rules \\\\nshall apply:\\\\n1.request submission: Shareholders wishing to sell their shares need to submit a \\\\nformal request to the company. This request must include essential information \\\\nsuch as the shareholder\\\\'s name, address, the number and type of shares being \\\\nsold and the proposed sale price. The request can be sent via registered mail or \\\\ndelivered in person to the company\\\\'s headquarters, with a receipt needed to con’rm \\\\nthe submission date;\\\\n2.approval timeline: The company has 60 days to respond to the request. If \\\\nthe company does not respond within this period, the request is automatically \\\\nconsidered approved;\\\\n3.objection process: If the board or the managing partners object to the sale, they \\\\nmust act within 60 days of notifying the shareholder. They have two options, namely:\\\\nIpropose an alternative buyer: The board can suggest another buyer, either \\\\nfrom existing shareholders or outside the company, to purchase the shares; \\\\nand\\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nIbuy the shares themselves: The board may choose to buy back the shares, \\\\neither to reduce its capital or for other legal reasons; and\\\\n4.deemed approval: If the board does not take any action within the speci’ed period, \\\\nthe inaction is interpreted as approval of the transfer, allowing the shareholder to \\\\nproceed with the sale.\\\\nThis framework is intended to regulate share transfers while protecting the companyWs \\\\ninterests and ensuring that shareholders can still transfer their shares under speci’ed \\\\nconditions.\\\\n•ith respect to the mandatory reporting to shareholders, the board of directors shall \\\\nprovide the shareholders with the following information:\\\\n1.a detailed description or report, including all the expenses by the board and all \\\\nrelevant privileges; and\\\\n2.’nancial statements and management reports.\\\\nIt should be noted that shareholders typically receive information about upcoming \\\\nmeetings, including agendas, ’nancial statements and other relevant documents at least \\\\n23 days (and at least 30 for provision of the ’nancial statements, management reports \\\\nand the auditorWs report) before the meeting. This time frame can vary depending on the \\\\ntype of data and information disclosed.\\\\nProxy solicitation is commonly practised; shareholders often receive proxy materials, \\\\nallowing them to vote on matters without attending the meeting in person. This \\\\nfacilitates participation, especially for those unable to attend. Moreover, it is common for \\\\nshareholders to express their views in advance of conveying the relevant general assembly \\\\nmeetings.\\\\nOutlook and conclusions\\\\nThe legal and regulatory framework governing corporate governance in Egypt has \\\\nundergone signi’cant reforms aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability and \\\\noperational eUciency within the corporate sector. The laws and regulations have set \\\\nforth guidelines intended to align practices with international standards. However, despite \\\\nthese advancements, challenges persist in the implementation phase. Issues such as \\\\nlack of coordination between the relevant governmental authorities continue to hinder the \\\\neffective application of the governance frameworks.\\\\nOverall, the developments within corporate governance have begun to foster a more \\\\nfavourable investment climate in Egypt such as the issuance of several decrees by \\\\nGAFI to reduce the number of documents required regarding corporate governance \\\\nprocedures. These decrees are intended to streamline the use of online services for \\\\ncorporate governance procedures including, for example, the incorporation of companies \\\\nand protecting the minorities of the listed companies from the optional delisting from \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nEGX by issuing decrees that limit the powers of the majority of shareholders in listed \\\\ncompanies.\\\\n•e expect that the development strategy of the corporate governance rules in Egypt \\\\nwill focus on increasing the use of technology, online services, eliminating routine and \\\\npaper-based procedures and implementing the global corporate governance standards. \\\\nThis will result in companies complying properly with corporate governance rules, \\\\naccelerating and facilitating corporate governance procedures and attracting further \\\\ninvestments to Egypt.\\\\nMohamed Hashish m.hashishJshandpartners.com\\\\nRana El Helbawi r.elhelbawiJshandpartners.com\\\\nAhmed Nour a.nourJshandpartners.com\\\\nAbdallah Elmasry a.elmasryJshandpartners.com\\\\nSoliman, Hashish & Partners\\\\nRead more from this 3rm on Lexology\\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n    content_length: 29507\\\\n    word_count: 4553\\\\n    processing_timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:41:10.474735\\\\n    status: success\\\\n\\\\n  -     filename: OCI 2025 AGM agenda.pdf\\\\n    filepath: C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\amros\\\\\\\\Downloads\\\\\\\\iVolution\\\\\\\\data\\\\\\\\OCI 2025 AGM agenda.pdf\\\\n    file_extension: .pdf\\\\n    mime_type: application/pdf\\\\n    metadata:       size_bytes: 345986\\\\n      created_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:25.898424\\\\n      modified_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:26.500268\\\\n      file_hash: 85c180022a1bdfbc9afb237885a06dcf744b2d13725145107d2dcd060b42a1f0\\\\n\\\\n    content: --- Page 1 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 1 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nAGENDA AND EXPLANATORY NOTES TO  \\\\nTHE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF  SHAREHOLDERS OF  \\\\nOCI N.V.  \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V.

The market price is defined as the average closing  price of the ordinary shares on Euronext \\\\nAmsterdam o n the five trading days prior to the date of the repurchase , provided that for self -tender \\\\noffers, accelerated repurchase arrangements and other similar repurchase programs as determined by \\\\nthe Board  of Directors , the market price shall be the average of the closing  price of the ordinary shares on \\\\nEuronext Amsterdam during a period as determined by the Board  of Directors , which shall be at least one \\\\ntrading day .  \\\\n \\\\nResolutions by the Board of Directors to repurchase  shares can only be adopted with the consent of the \\\\nmajority of the Non -Executive Directors.   \\\\n \\\\nIn light of OCI\\\\'s strategic review , the Company’s substantial transformation  and the potential for further \\\\nextraordinary  cash distributions  to shareholders , the Board of Directors considers it prudent  at this \\\\njuncture to maximise  the Company’s  flexibility and its available p athways to effect such  future returns of \\\\ncapital ; these pathways include but are not limited to ordinary  cash dividends from the profit reserve , \\\\nfurther capital repayments (see agenda item 13 below) and share repurchases as included in this agenda \\\\nitem . The Board of Directors is there fore seeking the authority to repurchase up to a maximum of 30% of \\\\nthe total  issued share capital as of the date of the General Meeting , greater than  the 10%  standard \\\\nauthorisation granted in previous years . As set out in more detail under item 12, the Board of Directors \\\\nwill resolve to cancel any shares held by the Company in excess of 10% of the issued share capital.   \\\\n \\\\nItem 12 – Proposal to cancel shares in the share capital of the Company ( resolution ) \\\\nIt is proposed by the Board of Directors with the consent of the Non -Executive Directors, to cancel some  \\\\nor all shares in the share capital of the Company held or repurchased by the Company under the \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 6 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\nauthorization referred to under agenda item 11 above. This cancellation may be executed in one or more \\\\ntranches. The number of shares that will be cancelled (whether or not in a tranche) will be determined by \\\\nthe Board of Directors , provided that the Board of Directors will in any event cancel all shares the Company \\\\nmay hold in excess of 10% of the Company\\\\'s issued share capital.   \\\\n \\\\nPursuant to the relevant statutory provisions, cancellation may not be effectuated until two months after \\\\nthe resolution to cancel has been adopted and publicly announced (this will apply to each tranche).  \\\\n \\\\nItem  13 – Two proposals to amend the Articles of Association to facilitate a capital repayment  (one \\\\ncombined resolution ) \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction  \\\\nThe Company proposes the payment of an extraordinary interim cash distribution of up to USD 1 billion  \\\\nin total  subject to closing of  the sale of 100% of the Company\\\\'s  equity interests in its Global Methanol \\\\nBusiness, to Methanex Corporation, as announced on 9 September 2024 , the strategic review and Board \\\\napproval.  \\\\n \\\\nIn this connection, the General Meeting will be requested to resolve on two subsequent amendments to \\\\nthe Articles of Association to facilitate that the extraordinary interim cash distribution can be made as a \\\\nrepayment of capital or, at the election of the  shareholder, as a payment from the profit reserve, subject \\\\nto Dutch Dividend Withholding tax.  Shareholders that do not make a choice, will participate in the \\\\nrepayment of capital. A choice for one option implies an opt -out of the other option.  \\\\n \\\\nIn addition, shareholders will have the opportunity to elect a payment in EUR instead of USD. The \\\\nCompany will make a distribution in USD unless the relevant shareholder has opted for a distribution in \\\\nEUR. The applicable USD/EUR exchange rate will be dete rmined by the Board of Directors  based on an \\\\nauthoritative source.  \\\\n \\\\nThe amount that will be repaid to shareholders has not yet been determined and remains subject to the \\\\ndiscretion of the Board of Directors  provided that the amount that will be distributed shall not exceed \\\\nUSD 1 billion in total , respectively the EUR equivalent thereof.    \\\\n \\\\nFurther details  on the distribution  will be announced by the Company  in a timely  manner  before the \\\\ndistribution  become s payable .  \\\\n \\\\nProposals to amend the Articles of Association twice in connection with the capital repayment  \\\\nIt is proposed to the General Meeting under this agenda item 13 to amend the Articles of Association \\\\ntwice in accordance with the proposed draft deed s of amendment as reflected in a triptych in Dutch and \\\\nin an unofficial English translation, which is available on the Company\\\\'s website  (www.oci -global.com ) as \\\\nwell as at the Company\\\\'s offices.  \\\\n \\\\nThe resolution to amend the Articles of Association twice also includes the authorization of each member \\\\nof the Board of Directors  as well as each lawyer and paralegal practising with De Brauw Blackstone \\\\nWestbroek N.V. to execute the two notarial deeds of amendment to the Articles of Association.  \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 7 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPursuant to the first amendment, the nominal value per share  will be increased with an EUR amount which \\\\nequals the amount of the USD distribution taking into account the exchange rate selected by the Board of \\\\nDirectors  as described above (subject to an upward adjustment due to rounding). The amount of the \\\\nincrease will not exceed the maximum amount of the decrease described below.  \\\\n \\\\nPursuant to the second, subsequent amendment, the nominal value of the shares will be reduced again \\\\nto the original amount of EUR 0.02. The amount of the reduction per share , as yet to be determined by \\\\nthe Board of Directors , will be distributed to the Company\\\\'s shareholders as a repayment of capital \\\\n(subject to the election mechanism described above).  \\\\n \\\\nThis voting item requires a simple majority of votes cast if 50% or more of the issued share capital is \\\\nrepresented. If less than 50% of the issued share capital is represented, this proposal can only be adopted \\\\nby a majority of at least two -thirds of the votes cast.  \\\\n \\\\nCapital reduction requirements  \\\\nPursuant to Dutch law, the reduction of capital is subject to a formal procedure. This procedure entails \\\\ncustomary filings with the Dutch Trade Register and observation of a two -month creditor opposition \\\\nperiod as described in Section 2:100 of the Dutch Ci vil Code. For purposes of these filings the maximum \\\\naggregate amount of the distribution must be specified. Solely for this purpose  an aggregate maximum \\\\ndistribution of EUR 5.47 per share will be taken into account.  \\\\n \\\\nUnder the provisions of Section 2:100 of the Dutch Civil Code, creditors may lodge objections to the capital \\\\nreduction within a period of two months following the announcement of the filing of the resolution to \\\\nreduce the share capital with the Dutch Trade Register. The amendment to the Articles of Association \\\\neffecting the capital reduction may only be implemented after such two -month creditor opposition period \\\\nhas lapsed, provided that no creditor objections have been received by the Amsterdam District Co urt or, \\\\nin the event objections have been received, after such opposition has been withdrawn, resolved or lifted \\\\nby an enforceable court order by the relevant court in the Netherlands. The amendments to the Articles \\\\nof Association, as well as the distribut ion, shall only take place thereafter.  \\\\n \\\\nItem 14 – Proposal to appoint PWC as auditor charged with the auditing of the Annual Accounts for the \\\\nfinancial year 202 5 (resolution)  \\\\nIt is proposed to instruct PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. to audit the Annual Accounts for the \\\\nfinancial year 202 5. \\\\n \\\\nItem  15 - Proposal to appoint PWC as auditor charged with the assurance of the Sustainability Reporting \\\\nfor the financial year 2025  (resolution)  \\\\nIn anticipation of , and subject to  (i) the transpo sition of the Corporate Sust ainability Rep orting Directive \\\\n(CSRD) into Dutch law  and (ii) applicability of such law to OCI during the financial year 2025 , it is proposed \\\\nto appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. as auditor to carry out the  mandatory  limited \\\\nassurance review of the Sustainability Reporting for the financial year 2025.  \\\\n \\\\n=====================================================================================  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 8 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nBIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS  REQUIRED UNDER ARTICLE 14(3) OF THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION  \\\\n \\\\nMr. Nassef Sawiris  \\\\n \\\\nYear of birth:  1961   \\\\nNationality: Egyptian  and Belgian  citizen  \\\\n \\\\nProfile and current positions: Mr. Nassef Sawiris is the Executive Chair of the Company .

At the heart of Sharia law are the maqasid Al-Sharia \\\\nhigher objectives aimed at safeguarding and promoting faith, life, intellect, lineage, \\\\nand wealth. These principles closely parallel the core principles of sustainability, \\\\nwhich focus on meeting present needs while ensuring future generations can \\\\nprosper.\\\\nRESILIENT ISLAMIC BANKING\\\\nAs an Islamic bank, ADIB Egypt is inherently resilient due to its risk-sharing financial \\\\nmodel, ethical investment principles, and emphasis on real economic activity. By \\\\nutilizing asset-backed financing, the Bank ensures that transactions are tied to \\\\ntangible assets, reducing financial vulnerabilities and promoting long-term stability. \\\\nThis approach minimizes speculative risks and strengthens economic resilience, \\\\ncontributing to a more sustainable and stable financial system.\\\\nETHICAL FINANCE, GROWING ECONOMY\\\\nADIB Egypt adheres to Sharia principles and promotes sustainability by integrating \\\\nethical practices into its operations and financing. The Bank is committed to \\\\nupholding human rights and ethical labor practices by offering fair wages and \\\\nopposing any form of exploitation, harm, or unethical labor practices. \\\\nThe Bank also ensures fairness in financial transactions by prohibiting interest, \\\\nfostering an economy built on shared risk and social equity. Additionally, ADIB \\\\nEgypt also prohibits financing activities linked to ethically and health-harmful \\\\nindustries, such as alcoholic beverages. \\\\nBy promoting ethical investments, ADIB Egypt encourages individuals to actively \\\\nparticipate in the economy while discouraging idle money. Through profit-sharing \\\\nmodels like Mudarabah, the Bank channels funds into Sharia-compliant businesses, \\\\ndriving continuous economic activity, job creation, and long-term sustainable \\\\ndevelopment. \\\\nENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN ISLAM\\\\nADIB Egypt upholds the Sharia principle of stewardship of the Earth (Khilafah), \\\\nwhich calls for protecting natural resources and minimizing environmental harm. \\\\nThe Bank strictly avoids wastefulness (Israf) and excessive consumption, promoting \\\\na balanced and responsible use of resources. This commitment aligns with modern \\\\nsustainability efforts focused on resource conservation, pollution reduction, and \\\\nresponsible ecosystem management.\\\\nFurthermore, ADIB Egypt prohibits financing activities related to environmentally \\\\nharmful industries, such as tobacco production, and discourages the use of \\\\nproducts containing harmful chemicals that negatively impact human health and \\\\nthe environment. \\\\nBy integrating these principles into its operations, the Bank fosters an eco-\\\\nconscious approach to finance, ensuring that its economic activities support long-\\\\nterm sustainability and do not compromise the well-being of future generations. \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\n22 23\\\\nADIB Egypt sustainability Report 2024 ADIB Egypt sustainability Report 2024\\\\nPillars Strategic Objectives Relevant Capital Relevant Material TopicsEgypt’s Vision \\\\n2030 AlignmentSDGs \\\\nAlignment\\\\n1.

This process is guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 3: Material Topics and the \\\\nEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Stakeholder engagement remains central to the \\\\nassessment, allowing us to capture diverse perspectives and enhance the relevance and impact of our \\\\nfindings. \\\\nIn 2024, ADIB Egypt conducted a multi-phase materiality assessment process consisting of the following steps:\\\\nSTAKEHOLDER \\\\nIDENTIFICATION\\\\nWe began by mapping our broad range \\\\nof stakeholders, employees, customers, \\\\ninvestors, regulators, management, the \\\\nboard of directors, and the community.\\\\nDOUBLE MATERIALITY \\\\nAPPROACH\\\\nTo prioritise the most impactful topics,\\\\nADIB Egypt applied a scoring framework\\\\nthat assessed each issue from two \\\\ndimensions: financial and impact \\\\nmaterialityIDENTIFICATION\\\\nOF MATERIAL TOPICS\\\\nNext, we identified key topics critical to our \\\\nstrategic direction and resilience through:\\\\nActive stakeholder engagement to gather \\\\nvaluable insights into their concerns and \\\\nexpectations.\\\\nReview of regulatory obligations, including \\\\ncompliance with the Central Bank of Egypt \\\\n(CBE).\\\\nBenchmarking against ADIB Group and \\\\nindustry peers.\\\\nAlignment with ADIB’s strategic priorities \\\\nacross the short, medium, and long term.\\\\nConsideration of global sustainability \\\\ntrends, developments in the financial \\\\nsector, and Egypt’s national priorities.1\\\\n32This dual-lens approach known as double materiality ensures that our materiality matrix reflects \\\\nnot only what is important to ADIB’s financial success but also to the well-being of society and the \\\\nenvironment. The resulting matrix provides a clear view of our top sustainability priorities, guiding our \\\\nreporting, decision-making, and long-term strategy. \\\\nEvaluates how an environmental, \\\\nsocial,

The Code \\\\nserves as a guide for best practices in the fields  of governance, transparency and \\\\nprudent management, for all stakeholders of the company adopting the Code.  \\\\nThe importance of such update process stems from the significant  developments \\\\nwitnessed in the global arena in the area of governance principles , and the growing  \\\\ninterest of many entities in  this particular topic, be they inte rnational organizations; \\\\nfinancial  institutions; mutual funds  and investme nt companie s; retail investors; or \\\\ndifferent types of non -government al organizations.   \\\\nHence, the concerned  entity in Egypt – the Egyptian Institute of Directors EIoD – \\\\nhas had to keep abreast with these developments, and to adopt the best practices in \\\\nthis field. The EI oD was of the view that the Code should not be confined to a \\\\nparticular type of companies , but rather be general, so as to allow various \\\\ncompanies, public and private, to select the appropriate rules that fit them best.  \\\\nFor the purpose of up dating this Code, a working group has been formed of market \\\\nexperts and EI oD staff. Throughout several months,  the work ing group has revised \\\\nthe Code and has got acquainted with the best principles and applications adopted \\\\nby relevant international organiz ations.  \\\\nOn behalf of the EFSA Board  of Directors  and myself , we would like to extend our \\\\nsincere apprecia tion for the efforts made by this working group.    \\\\n \\\\nEgyptian Financial Supervisory Authority  \\\\n               Sherif Samy  \\\\n      Chairman  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 4 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n4 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n Contents  \\\\n  Page  \\\\nIntroduction   6 \\\\nChapter One: General Framework of Corporate Governance  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.1 Egyptian Corporate Governance Code  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.2 The Role of the State , Legislative and Regulatory \\\\nEntities  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.3 Concept of Corporate Governance  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.4 Objectives and Benefits  of Implementing \\\\nCorporate Governance Principles  10 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.5 Scope of A pplication  11 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.6 The “ Comply or Explain” Rule  11 \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 1.7 References Used in Drafting the Egyptian \\\\nCorporate Governance Code  11 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.8 Definitions  13 \\\\n \\\\nChapter Two: Main Pillars  of Corporate Governa nce  17 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.1 First Pillar : General Assembly  of Shareholders  17 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.2 Second Pillar: Board  of Directors  19 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.3 Third Pillar : Board  Committees  27 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.4 Fourth Pillar : Control  Environment  34 \\\\n \\\\nChapter Three: Disclosure and Transparency  41 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 3.1 Introduction to Disclosure and Transparency  41 \\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n5 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n \\\\uf0b7  3.2 Material Information , and Financial and Non-\\\\nFinancial Disclosure  41 \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 3.3 Investor Relations                                                             42 \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 3.4 Disclosure Tool s 45 \\\\n  \\\\nChapter Four: Corporate Governance Codes, Charters  and Policies  51 \\\\n              First: Codes and Charters  51 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.1 Code of  Ethics and Business Conduct  51 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.2.Board  of Directors ’ Charter   51 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.3 Board  Committees  Charters  52 \\\\n             Second: Policie s 52 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.4 Succession Planning  Policy  52 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.5.

The Code came in recognition of the important  \\\\nrole the public business sector plays in the Egyptian economy, as it comprises a \\\\ncluster of leading companies engaged in all types  of strategic industries in the \\\\ncountry. The Code affirms the role of the State; being the owner of this vital sector, \\\\nenhances the sector’s controls and supervision and ensures its effective operation.  \\\\nIn 2011, seeking to keep up  to date  with the best pra ctices at the international and \\\\nregional levels, in terms of the roles of Board s of directors, the EI oD revised  the \\\\nCorporate Governance Code for listed companies , in line with the governance  \\\\nguidelines at the time. The EI oD recommended that the various co ntrols in \\\\ncompanies b e activated. It also tackled Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) . \\\\nApplication of the “ Comply or Explain” rule was also recommended.  \\\\n \\\\nWhat is new in this version of  the Egyptian Corporate Governance Code?   \\\\nThe EI oD worked on upgrading an d updating the previous codes, consolidating \\\\nthem into one single code, bearing the name  of “Egyptian Corporate Governance \\\\nCode”. To do so, the EI oD:  \\\\nFirst : has broadened the application of the last version of the Code, in terms of \\\\ngenerality and comprehe nsiveness , capturing to this end the latest international and \\\\nregional practices a nd standards in good governance  and addressing the full \\\\nspectrum  of companies in Egypt according to their nature, complexity and size, \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n7 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n and in a manner that allows them the freedom  to apply what fits them best, and to \\\\nset future plans to address the  remaining rules for  the effective functioning of \\\\ncorporate governance over the medium and long terms . The aim  is to ensure full \\\\napplication of good governance principles consistent with the company’s pace of \\\\ngrowth, complexity and size.  \\\\nSecond : has introduced the Code as  indicative  guidelines for all legislative and \\\\nregulatory bodies when enacting and updating regulations and legislation related to \\\\ncorporate governance in the Arab R epublic of Egypt.  \\\\nHereunder is an overview of the updates and modifications introduced to this \\\\nedition of Egyptian Corporate Governance Code:  \\\\na. Setting a general methodology in drafting the Governance Code, indicating \\\\nthe necessity of having in place an adva nced corporate governance manual  \\\\nin Egypt, and highlighting the important role assumed  by the State, its \\\\ngovernment and institutions in supporting the governance concept and \\\\napplications;  \\\\nb. Underscoring  the importance of good governance, and highlighting  the \\\\nbenefi ts that companies can gain from  its application ; \\\\nc. Clearly determining the scope of application of these principles, and the \\\\nextent of their compatibility with the nature and size of each company;  \\\\nd. Paying special attention to the “ Comply or E xplain ” rule, as a fundamental \\\\npillar  that paves the way for enforcing the implementation  of the  principles;  \\\\ne. Spreading the awareness  and knowledge  of concepts and terminologies  \\\\nemployed in the Code, to accelerate  users ’ understanding of its contents;  \\\\nf. Stressing  the role of the General Assembly  of Shareholders  in electing an \\\\neffective Board  of Directors  to achieve the company’s objectives;  \\\\ng. Placing greater  emphasis on  the role of the Board  of Directors ; as a key \\\\nelement in managing and directing the company, in additi on to  its main \\\\nresponsibility for the application of governance  principles . The Code  also \\\\ndealt with  the optimal composition of Board  of Directors , in terms of \\\\ndiversity  and responsibility . The Code also  illustrates the different types  of \\\\nBoard  Committees  that assist the Board  in performing its functions and \\\\nduties;  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n8 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n h. Addressing  in detail the role an d responsibilities of the Board  Secretary  in \\\\nthe organization , according to international best practices;   \\\\ni. Placing more focus on the components of control  enviro nment  and its \\\\nsignificant importance in any company, starting from internal control   \\\\nj. Emphasiz ing the role  on External Auditors , Internal Audit, Risk \\\\nManagement, and Compliance Departments; and recommending that each \\\\ncompany should have in place a departmen t for Corporate Governance;  in \\\\nlight of the key role they play;  \\\\nk. Shedding more light on Investor Relations  activity in listed companies ; \\\\nl. Tackling the various disclosure methods and tools ; and highlighting the \\\\nimportance of non-financial disclosure , clarifyi ng the material information  \\\\nthat should be disclosed by different periodic reports; and  \\\\nm. Suggesting policies, codes and manuals  that companies  should develop and \\\\napply, to organize their internal work in respect of corporate governance.  \\\\nThis Code aims to s upport and assist all companies that wish to understand and \\\\napply good governance as an integrated approach towards growth and \\\\nsustainability, thereby achieving EI oD’s mission  and strategy for the benefit of the \\\\ncompanies ’ stakeholders  and the national eco nomy at large .  \\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n9 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n Chapter One  \\\\nGeneral Framework of Corporate Governance  \\\\n \\\\n1.1 Egyptian Corporate Governance Code  \\\\nThe Egyptian Corporate Governance Code is considered a comprehensive and \\\\ngeneral framework of governance and its relevant issues. It encompasses a se t \\\\nof guiding rules of corporate governance, based on international and regional \\\\nbest practices, to serve as guidelines for the application of corporate \\\\ngovernance in all kinds of companies in Egypt. The Code also helps as a guide \\\\nto legislators in enacting  the regulatory legislation and instructions related to \\\\ngovernance applications. The Code does not contradict  with the Joint Stock \\\\nCompanies Law No. 159 of 1981 or its Executive Regulations; the Capital \\\\nMarket Law No. 95 of 1992 or its Executive Regulation s; or Egyptian \\\\nExchange Listing and Delisting Rules to be issued by the EFSA Board  of \\\\nDirectors.   \\\\n1.2 The role of the State , legislative and regulatory authorities  \\\\nThe State, represented by the government , and legislative and regulatory \\\\nbodies , plays a pivota l role in adopting a clear approach for a gradual and \\\\nobjectiv e development of the regulatory  system of corporate governance, that \\\\nallows for the application of the underlying principles outlined in this Code on \\\\nthe full spectrum of companies in Egypt, acc ording to their respective size, \\\\ncomplexity and nature of business, while assisting and supporting the entities \\\\nengaged in promoting and spreading public awareness of governance culture \\\\nand applications. The aim is to attain the overriding objective of rai sing the \\\\nstandard of application of governance principles by employing proper \\\\nmethods, which all stakeholders can reap their fruits, namely firmly \\\\nestablishing the concept of prudent management, enhancing transparency and \\\\ndisclosure, minimizing corruption,  and ensuring equitable treatment of all \\\\ninvestors, especially protection of the rights of small investors.  \\\\n1.3 Concept of corporate governance  \\\\nGenerally, corporate governance is the set of rules, principles and systems that \\\\ngovern the relationship between the  Board  of Directors , on one hand, and a \\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n10 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n company’s owners and other stakeholders, on the other hand, with a view to \\\\nachieving the best protection and alignment of interests of these parties.  \\\\n1.4 Objectives and benefits of implementing corporate governance  \\\\nEgypt ian companies ought  to implement and comply with governance \\\\nprinciples, not just for the sake of  complying with  laws and regulations, but \\\\nbecause these principles bring to the company numerous benefits. \\\\nAdditionally, they upgrade the investment climate , and boost economic growth \\\\nin general.  \\\\nCharacterized by  its applicability, corporate governance has several benefi ts, \\\\nnamely : \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Protects rights, not only the rights of the company’s shareholders, \\\\nowners, employees, but also the other stakeholders; such as custo mers, \\\\ncreditors, suppliers and state bodies, and ultimately protects the society \\\\nas a whole, as well as the environment in which the company operates;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Achieves  the best possible sustainability for companies;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Improves companies efficient operation and stren gthens control on \\\\ntheir performance;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Facilitates obtaining  the necessary funding and reduces capital cost;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Mitigates  the impact of risks and crisi s; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Seeks to avoid conflict of interests  in respect of transactions of insider s \\\\nand related parties; and  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Assist s the institutionalization of family  owned  firms. \\\\nBy implementing corporate governance, closed joint -stock companies can \\\\nmore easily list their shares on the Exchange. This requires the attention of \\\\nshareholder s and management of the company  to monitor the  implementation \\\\nof governance principles as a prelude to the company’s listing. The proper \\\\npreparation for eligibility for public offering or listing is guaranteed by a prior \\\\nsound implementa tion of governance principles.  \\\\nCorporate governance is a culture  that has to be inherent in  the company’s \\\\ncore, and should be adopted as its vision and long term strategy that has to be \\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n11 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n implemented on a n ongoing  basis, and not only on the short run. Accordingly, \\\\nthe expected role to be assumed by those managing compani es, financial \\\\ninstitutions, professional societies, business  associations, retail and institutional \\\\ninvestors is to spread and promote the culture of corporate governance, putting \\\\nthe present Principles into force, and deeming companies’ application of \\\\ncorporate governance as an indication  of their success and distinction . \\\\n1.5 Scope of application  \\\\nWithout prejudice to all applicable legislation and regulations governing the \\\\nbusiness of all  types of  companies in the Arab Republic of Egypt, these \\\\nPrinciples s hall apply to all listed and unlisted companies, banking  and non -\\\\nbanking  financial institutions, industrial, commercial and service companies , \\\\nregardless of their size and nature of activity, whether they are family firms, or \\\\npublicly owned.  \\\\nAlso integral to the foregoing is that sound corporate governance does not only \\\\nmean adhering to a set of principles and interpr eting them narrowly and \\\\nliterally , but it also means a culture and a mechanism that governs the \\\\nrelationship among the business owners, its Board of Directors  and \\\\nstakeholders. Therefore, the broader the application of good governance , the \\\\ngreater the benefit for the society as a whole.  \\\\n1.6 The “ Comply or Explain” principle  \\\\nAs a rule, and without prejudice to the mandatory compliance with laws a nd \\\\nregulations, a company  should  typically  seek to apply all the  relevant  \\\\nprinciples outlined in this Code. If it fails to do so, for whatever reason, the \\\\ncompany must provide an objective and justifiable explanation, in application \\\\nof the “comply or expla in” principle.  Every company is required to  consider \\\\nall the principles outlined in the present Code, specify  the principles it \\\\ncomplies with and those it deviates from, the justifications of non -compliance, \\\\nand its future plan for implementing them. This  report is to be posted on the \\\\ncompany’s website and be published in its annual report for shareholders.  \\\\n1.7  References used in drafting the Egyptian Corporate Governance Code  \\\\nIn drafting and developing this Code, the EI oD has relied on many references, \\\\nsalien t of which is the Organization of Economic Cooperation and \\\\nDevelopment (OECD) Principles of Corporate Governance issued in 199 9, and \\\\ntheir amendments in 2004 and in 2015 introduced in the six main principles \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n12 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n that serve as a general benchmark of corporate g overnance all over the world. \\\\nThese principles are namely:  \\\\ni. General Framework:  this principle emphasizes the need to have in place an \\\\neffective corporate governance framework that ensures markets  transparency \\\\nand efficiency, and compli es with applicable leg islations and laws. The \\\\nsegregation of responsibilities among the different legislative and \\\\nsupervisory authorities should be clearly articulated;  \\\\nii.  The Rights and Equitable Treatment of Shareholders:  the corporate \\\\ngovernance framework should protect all sh areholder s’ rights, and ensure \\\\nequitable treatment of them all, including small  shareholders  and foreign \\\\nshareholders. Equally crucial is to make sure that all shareholders have the \\\\nopportunity to obtain actual indemnity , should their rights be violated;  \\\\niii. The Role of Institutional Investors, and other Intermediaries in Stock \\\\nMarkets:  the corporate governance framework should provide economic \\\\nincentives to institutional investors and other intermediaries in stock \\\\nmarkets throughout the investment chain to ens ure efficient functioning of \\\\nstock markets and optimal application of good corporate governance;  \\\\niv. The Role of Stakeholders:  the corporate governance framework should \\\\nensure that the rights of stakeholders established by law are recognized and \\\\nrespected. Als o important is to encourage cooperation between companies  \\\\nand different stakeholders to maximize wealth, create employment  \\\\nopportunities and achieve sustainability of financially sound enterprises;  \\\\nv. Disclosure and Transparency:  the corporate governance fram ework \\\\nshould ensure that timely and accurate disclosure is made on all significant \\\\nmatters leading to material developments affecting the company , including \\\\nthe financial situation, performance , ownership structure, and management  \\\\nof the company;  and \\\\nvi.  The Responsibilities of the Board  of Directors: the corporate governance \\\\nframework should provide  strategic guidance to the company,  and ensure s \\\\nthe effective monitoring of the executive management by the Board , and \\\\nthe Board ’s accountability to the company a nd the shareholders.  \\\\nThe EIoD was  also guided by some key references for updating the Code,  \\\\nincluding:  \\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n13 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 Cadbury’s Report issued in the United Kingdom in 1999;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Corporate Governance Methodology  developed by  IFC, at the World Bank \\\\nGroup ; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Corporate Governance Regulations for Banks, issued by the Central Bank \\\\nof Egypt in 2011;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The Principles drafted by the International Organization of Securities \\\\nCommissions (IOSCO) ; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Egyptian Exchange Listing and Delisting Rules, issued by EFSA in  Janua ry \\\\n2014, and their amendme nts; and  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Different regulations on corporate governance issued by EFSA.  \\\\nThe international and regional bes t practices have been reviewed , along with the \\\\nexperience of the different countries in implementing corporate governance, as \\\\nmain pillars in developin g the corporate governance system  in Egypt.  \\\\n Definitions  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 General Assembly : means  a meeting  that encompasses all the \\\\ncompany’s owners or shareholders;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Minority  Shareholders : means  shareholders that have a non -controlling \\\\ninterest in a company’s equity;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Rela ted Parties and Group s: means any group that is under  actual \\\\ncontrol of the natural or juridical  shareholders , or that has  an agreement \\\\non coordination upon  voting in the meetings of the General Assembly  or \\\\nBoard  of Directors  of the company ; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Control : means  any status , agreement or ownership of any percentage  of \\\\nshares, or interest, result s in controlling the appointment of the majority \\\\nof the Board  members, or influencing the decisions of the Board  or the \\\\nGeneral Assembly  of the company;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Board  of Directors : is the authority  elected by the General Assembly  \\\\nresponsible for setting objectives and strategies, and following up the \\\\nperformance of the management of the company pursuant to its articles \\\\nof association ;  \\\\n--- Page 14 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n14 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 Chairman of the Board  of Directors : is a membe r of the Board , \\\\nappointed by the other members of the Board  to chair the Board ’s \\\\nmeetings, and to be the  legal representative of the company;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Managing Director : is the Board  member delegated by the Board  to \\\\ncarry out the actual management of the company, a nd to be at the top of \\\\nthe management  hierarchy .

While the company’s \\\\narticles of association may stipulate that only shareholders with a specific \\\\nnumber of share s may attend the General Assembly , this provision shall be \\\\ndeemed an exception to the rule that allow s any shareholder to attend these \\\\nmeetings, and shall only apply when the number of shareholders  are too \\\\nlarge that makes it difficult for the company to arrange for a place for the \\\\nmeeting. Importantly, the foregoing provision should not be used as a means \\\\nto ignore  or exclude  the minority shareholders.  \\\\n2.1.2 Participation in the General Assembly  \\\\nShareholders should be encouraged to attend the General  Assembly . To this \\\\nend, arrangements should be made for facilitating their participation, \\\\nincluding, inter alia, choice of the appropriate place and time. Companies \\\\nwith large number of members  can use  electronic means  and different \\\\ncommunication systems , according t o the international best practices, for \\\\nonline transmitting or recording  of the proceedings of the meeting for  \\\\nshareholders abroad or at home.  Equally crucial is to  facilitate shareholders’  \\\\nparticipation  procedures , provided that the company’s  bylaw and ar ticles of \\\\nassociation  should be observed , in respect of the procedures of calling for \\\\nthe General Assembly  and the method of running the meeting . \\\\n2.1.3 Procedures of the General Assembly  \\\\nA secretary for the General Assembly  and ballot teller s shall be appointed,  \\\\nprovided that they are not members of the General Assembly  or the Board  of \\\\nDirectors .  \\\\nThe General Assembly  shall be run in a way that allows shareholders to \\\\nexpress their views, according to  the company’s bylaw and articles of \\\\nassociation and consistent with the meeting’s  agenda. The company’s \\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n18 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n management has to provide a full and efficient disclosure of the issues  \\\\noutlined  in the agenda.   \\\\nAny issue  in the agenda of the ordinary or extraordinary General Assembly , \\\\nshould  be accompanied with relevant data a nd information that help \\\\nshareholders take their decisions . The intent of providing such information is \\\\nto allow shareholders to take  informed and sound decisions, and not just to \\\\nsatisfy the formalities  of the meeting. Answers  should be made to all \\\\nquesti ons and inquiries  raised by shareholders, even if submitted  before the \\\\nmeeting  for inclusion in the agenda, or rather  sufficient time  should be \\\\nallocated during the meeting for responses to such inquires .  \\\\n2.1.4 Resolutions of the General Assembly  \\\\nIt is recommen ded that  the “cumulative voting” system is adopted, provided \\\\nthat the company\\\\'s statute so stipulates. The aim is to ensure that all \\\\nshareholders are represented when electing Board  directors, so that the final \\\\nresults of such election reflect the relative  representation of all shareholders.  \\\\nWhen called for electing the Board  of Directors , shareholders should be \\\\nfurnished with short curriculum vitae about each candidate.  \\\\nVoting on the General Assembly \\\\'s resolutions should be accurately recorded. \\\\nIf a dispu te arises about the validity of some votes on all or any  resolutions \\\\nof the General Assembly , voting shall be taken , rendering  such votes valid \\\\nfor one time, and invalid for another time . The matter shall be later on  \\\\nreferred to the competent administrativ e or juridical body . This is meant to \\\\nkeep  the procedure of the General Assembly  uninterrupted in all \\\\ncircumstances.   \\\\nSubject to applicable laws and the company ’s articles of association , \\\\nminority shareholders holding not less than 5% of the company\\\\'s share \\\\ncapital are entitled to place  items on the General Assembly \\\\'s agenda, and to \\\\nfile objections  with the administrative  body to any resolutions  of the General \\\\nAssembly . In turn, the administrative body shall  suspend those  resolutions  \\\\npassed in favor of the  majority shareholders agai nst the minority \\\\nshareholders. Additionally, the General Assembly  must be called when 3 % \\\\nor more of  shareholders make a request , as specified  by law within the \\\\nframework of protecting the minority shareholder rights.   \\\\nThe Genera l Assembly  secretary shall record in the minute s of the meeting \\\\nall the discussions, events and resolutions brought about by  the meeting. The \\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n19 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n company should disclose the resolutions passed and the material  events \\\\noccurred, to all shareholders simultaneousl y. Minutes of the company’s \\\\nGeneral Assemblie s shall be posted on the company’s website, and shall be \\\\nmade available to the public as much as practicable.   \\\\nListed companies are required to promptly furnish  the EFSA and the \\\\nEgyptian  Stock  Exchange with the resolutions passed by the ordinary and \\\\nextraordinary General Assembly  immediately after the end of each meeting, \\\\nnot be later than the  commencement of the trading session next to the date of \\\\nthe relevant meeting. This is meant to ensure the fair availabil ity of the \\\\ninformation to all.  \\\\nWhen carrying out transactions with affil iated groups  or entering into related \\\\nparty transactions , the Board  of Directors  has to obtain the General \\\\nAssembly ’s prior approval, so that conflict of interests  can be avoided, \\\\nspecifically with major  shareholders, Board  members, insiders, or other \\\\nrelevant companies.  A related party  transaction must be carried out on an \\\\nunbiased and objective basis . The  relevant party to a related party \\\\ntransaction shall not be entitled to vote in the General Assembly . Related \\\\nparty  transactions should be implemented in such a way that does not \\\\njeopardize the interests of the company and other stakeholders. Equally \\\\nimportant is the full disclosure of all these  transactions, whether about the  \\\\nrelated  party transactions  offered  for the next year, or  those entered into in \\\\nthe previous year.      \\\\n2.2  Second Pillar : Board  of Directors  \\\\n2.2.1  Composition of the Board  of Directors  \\\\nSubject to the law and the company’s articles of association , the Board  of \\\\nDirectors  shall be made up of an adequate number of members that enable it \\\\nto perform  its functions a nd duties, including formation  of committee s. The \\\\nmajority of members must be non -executives, and at least two of them are \\\\nindependent members with technical and analy tical skills for the benefit of \\\\nthe Board  and the company. Guided by international best practices, the \\\\nBoard  composition  should ideally be made up of a diverse mix, unbiased to \\\\ngender  or faith. \\\\nIn all events, when electing independent non -executive members , \\\\nconsideration should be taken that a member can devote  the necessary time \\\\n--- Page 20 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n20 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n and care to the company, and that there is no conflict of interest with any \\\\nother commitments .  \\\\nSufficient information, data and description  about the company should be \\\\nfurnished  to incoming  Members of the Board  upon their appointment  to \\\\nensure that  they become  acquainted with all the general aspect s of the \\\\ncompany  and identify its strengths, weaknesses, managerial structure and its \\\\nfinancials , and all other matters that are necessa ry for performing their duties \\\\neffectively  and in the best possible way. The Board  Secretary acts as a \\\\nliaison between the Board  members, and between Board  members and top \\\\nmanagement  of the company .  \\\\nThe Board  of Directors shall elect the Chairman of the Board and shall \\\\nappoint the Managing D irector. It is not recommended that the posts  of the \\\\nChairman and Managing D irector be held by the same person. If splitting the \\\\ntwo posts  is not feasible , the reasons should be disclosed  in the company’s \\\\nannual report and on its website. In this case, an independent Deputy \\\\nChairman for the Board  of D irectors should be appointed, according to the \\\\ninternational best practices, to chair the meetings that discuss the \\\\nperformance of the executive management.       \\\\n2.2.2 Procedures  of Board  Meetings  \\\\nThe Board  of Directors  shall meet  at least once every three months. The \\\\nBoard  may, at its discretion, invite to its meetings any individuals from \\\\ninside or outside the company, to discuss issues related to the company. The \\\\nannual repor t of the company and report of the Board  of Directors  should \\\\ndisclose the number of meetings, names of members who failed to attend  the \\\\nmeetings of the Board  or its committee s. A member should by no means be \\\\nabsent for three Board  meetings  in a given  year.  Board  meetings  should be \\\\ncalled for at dates , venues , and under arrangements that facilitate the \\\\nmembers’ participation.  \\\\nMeetings of the Board  of Directors  may be convened via modern \\\\ncommunication means ; i.e. video conference, provided that the company’s  \\\\narticles of incorporation allow it . The Board  sets the rules governing the use \\\\nof such means  in its meetings and the remote participation of members.  \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n21 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n  \\\\n2.2.3 Role  and Responsibilities of the Board  \\\\nThe Board  of D irectors  is the body entrusted  with running the company’s \\\\naffairs, by delegation of the General Assembly . Hence , the ultimate \\\\nresponsibility of the company rests with the Board , notwithstanding the \\\\ncommittee s it may form, or the authority it  may mandate  to other \\\\norganizational units  or individuals. The Board ’s accountability for the \\\\ncompany’s management rests with the General Assembly  of shareholders. \\\\nThe decisions of the Board  are taken by  a majority vote.  \\\\nIf the Board  is forced by unforeseeable circumstances to approve decisions \\\\nby circulation , all Board members should participate in the voting on such \\\\ndecisions.  \\\\nA company’s Board  of D irector plays a vital and critical role in setting the \\\\nstrategic goals  of the business , approving the general plans and policies \\\\ngoverning the operation of the company, supervising the performance of the \\\\nexecutive management, ensuring the efficiency of internal controls and risk \\\\nmanagement, determining the optimal method for application of good \\\\ngovernance, and endorsing professional policies and ethics that the \\\\ncompany’s employees have to observe to upgrade their performan ce and \\\\nconduct. Therefore, the Board ’s decisions have a significant impact on the \\\\ncompany’s performance, that’s why such decisions should be made in the \\\\nbest interest s of the company, ensuring preservatio n of its assets and \\\\nmaximization of shareholders wealth.   \\\\nA member of the Board  of D irectors should consider himself a \\\\nrepresentative of all shareholders, committed to act in the best interests of \\\\nthe company and in particular the interests of other stake holders, rather than \\\\nacting in favor of the group  he/she  represents, or which has voted for his/her  \\\\nappointment.  \\\\nResponsibilities and duties of the Board  of Directors  include, without \\\\nlimitation:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Developing the  necessary mechanisms and systems that ensure \\\\ncompliance with laws, codes , and internal bylaws of the company by \\\\nall employees. The Board  shall also ensure that a n early warning  \\\\nsystem is in place for detection of  any breach or violation, and ensure \\\\n--- Page 22 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n22 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n that the appropriate  and prompt  action be taken .

Corporate \\\\ngovernance in banks emerged owing to the breathtaking developments in financial markets, cash \\\\nflow globalization and technological development which increased the competitive pressures \\\\namong banks and non-bank financial institutions. Moreover, the growth of financial markets and \\\\nthe variety in the bank financial instruments highlighted the impor tance of risk measurement, \\\\nmanagement and control. T o realize this, innovative methods should be continuously devised to \\\\nmanage business and risk; and changes should be introduced to laws and oversight systems, with a \\\\nview to maintaining a sound banking system.\\\\nNational Bank of Egypt (NBE) pays great attention to sound governance practices. NBE\\\\'s Board \\\\nis committed to apply the best standards of professional performance to all the Bank business \\\\nactivities. In this respect, NBE complies with the regulations of Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) which \\\\nalways endeavours to develop the banking sector and maintain its integrity through the application \\\\nof best international and local governance practices.  \\\\nThis Manual was developed by NBE and was first approved by its Board of Directors (BoD) in \\\\n2012. The Manual is revised, updated and amended biannually or as necessary to meet the changing \\\\nrequirements of NBE and regulatory authorities and be in line with the best international practices. \\\\nAn updated version is available on NBE\\\\'s website to the public.\\\\nGOVERNANCE WILL BE APPROACHED AS FOLLOWS:\\\\n1. Concept of Banking Governance \\\\n2. NBE Governance\\\\n1. CONCEPT OF BANKING GOVERNANCE\\\\n1.1 DEFINITION\\\\nGovernance is a system of relationships between the bank management, the Board, shareholders \\\\nand the other stakeholders , setting a clear definition of powers and responsibilities for each of \\\\nthem. Governance tackles the method adopted by the bank\\\\'s Board and senior management to \\\\nguide and oversee its affairs and daily activities, including the following:\\\\n. 1Developing strategies and setting objectives.\\\\n. 2Defining the bank’s risk appetite.\\\\n. 3Handling the bank’s daily business activities.\\\\n. 4Maintaining balance between assuming responsibility towards shareholders and protecting the \\\\ninterests of depositors, taking into consideration other stakeholders\\\\' interests.1\\\\n1-  A stakeholder is any person having an interest of any type in NBE, including employees, customers, suppliers and creditors.\\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group4. 5Ensuring that the bank’s business activities are conducted safely and properly within the \\\\nframework of applicable laws controls.\\\\n. 6Following effective disclosure and transparency policies.\\\\nThe Bank for International Settlements, under whose supervision Basel Committee on Banking \\\\nSupervision operates, defines banking governance as the methods by which the bank\\\\'s Board and \\\\nsenior management direct the bank. Such methods determine how to set the bank\\\\'s objectives and \\\\nstrategies and the means of achieving such objectives. Governance also ensures ongoing evaluation \\\\nof performance and compliance with the laws, regulations and banking norms in order to protect \\\\nthe interests of depositors, shareholders and stakeholders. The system of governance is the \\\\nframework which determines the appropriate distribution of powers and responsibilities and the \\\\nfoundations of decision-making.\\\\n1.2 BENEFITS OF GOVERNANCE\\\\nDeveloping an effective governance system is of paramount importance to ensure the proper \\\\nfunctioning of the banking sector and the economy as a whole. Banks play a vital role in supporting \\\\nthe national economy by injecting funds into businesses and projects which drive economic \\\\ngrowth. How banks are managed is key to financial stability which is critical for maintaining a \\\\nhealthy national economy. Weak governance systems in systemically important banks could cause \\\\ncontagion of crises to the banking sector and the economy at large.\\\\nBank governance deals with developing policies to enhance management productivity. It ensures \\\\nefficient application of regulatory rules and laws together with the elevation of the bank’s financial \\\\nperformance indicators within a proper organizational framework for the bank\\\\'s operations and \\\\npolicies. This would ensure accuracy in assigning responsibilities, control, performance evaluation \\\\nand the availability of personnel capable of perceiving such strategic role.\\\\nMoreover, governance is the best method that empowers managers to direct and enhance \\\\ncorporate performance. The best Board is the one which believes that maintaining an outstanding \\\\nperformance stems from maintaining the balance between wealth creation and control, promoting \\\\nthe highest standards in both areas.\\\\n2. NBE GOVERNANCE\\\\nNBE, an Egyptian joint stock company (S.A.E), was established on June 25,1898. It became a \\\\nstate-owned public entity by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 40 of 1960. It was subsequently \\\\nturned into an Egyptian joint stock company by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 44 of 1961. It is \\\\ncurrently a fully state-owned bank in the form of an Egyptian joint stock company which is subject \\\\nto the provisions of CBE and the Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020. NBE undertakes all banking \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group5activities performed by commercial banks in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations \\\\ngoverning such activities; the salient of which are:\\\\n. 1Accepting deposits, opening current accounts, procuring all forms of finance from Egypt \\\\nand abroad, and extending finance and credit facilities for different terms whether against \\\\nguarantees of different types or free of guarantees.\\\\n. 2Issuing shares and bonds, raising and accepting public subscriptions, and carrying out all the \\\\nactivities related to securities pursuant to the provisions of applicable laws and regulations.\\\\n. 3Handling collection and payment of orders, warrants and other papers of value.\\\\n. 4Issuing bonds, bills, cheques and notes whether payable in Egypt or abroad, except for bearer \\\\nbonds on demand, as well as discounting and negotiating bills, cheques and promissory notes of \\\\nany type whether payable in Egypt or abroad.\\\\n. 5Purchasing and selling securities at the Stock Exchange for its own account or on behalf of \\\\nothers.\\\\n. 6Providing custodian services in all forms and carrying out all securities-related activities.\\\\n. 7Making investments in corporations’ capital and taking part in establishing investment \\\\ncompanies and associations of capital.\\\\n. 8Dealing in financial derivatives to secure NBE and its customers against fluctuations in \\\\nexchange and interest rates in accordance with the rules and regulations of the CBE.\\\\n. 9Providing safe deposit box services.\\\\n. 10 Acting as an investment trustee for others.\\\\n. 11 Representing different banking entities.\\\\n. 12 Engaging in foreign exchange activities.\\\\n. 13 Doing the business of mutual funds, financial leasing, and real estate finance in accordance \\\\nwith CBE\\\\'s regulations.\\\\n. 14 Undertaking other necessary banking activities. In general, NBE carries out all banking, \\\\ncommercial and investment activities for the benefit of NBE or others or in participation with \\\\nother entities. In addition, NBE performs all other standard banking activities. NBE may, in \\\\nall respects, have interest in, partner with, purchase, affiliate to or merge under other banks, \\\\ncompanies, entities or bodies that conduct similar business or help NBE fulfill its purposes, \\\\nwhether in Egypt or abroad pursuant to the relevant governing laws and regulations.\\\\nNBE attaches great importance to sound governance practices. NBE\\\\'s Board applies the highest \\\\nprofessional performance standards to its all activities. In this regard, NBE complies with the Law of \\\\nthe Central Bank and Banking Sector promulgated under Law No. 194 of 2020, CBE’s instructions \\\\nand the best international practices. \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group6GOVERNANCE AT NBE IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES:\\\\n. 1Treatment of all stakeholders on the same basis.\\\\n. 2Transparency and disclosure to allow the relevant parties to evaluate NBE\\\\'s performance and \\\\nfinancial position.\\\\n. 3Balanced relationship between NBE\\\\'s management and the Board, as well as among the Board, \\\\nshareholders and other stakeholders.\\\\n. 4Responsibility and accountability by clear segregation of duties.\\\\n. 5Good example, as the conduct and behaviour of Board members give a good example for all \\\\nNBE\\\\'s management levels.\\\\n. 6Developing a Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management, explaining the work \\\\nphilosophy adopted by management.\\\\n. 7Introduction of the Whistleblowing and Whistle-blower Protection Policy.\\\\n. 8Designing and applying the conflict of interest policy.\\\\n. 9Social and environmental responsibility.\\\\nNBE is a pioneer in adhering to governance concepts. This is crystallized by how the Board and \\\\nsenior management direct and oversee NBE\\\\'s business and daily activities, which affects the \\\\nprocess of setting objectives and shouldering responsibility towards all stakeholders such as \\\\nbeneficiaries, depositors, regulatory bodies, and governments. NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management \\\\nalso do business and act professionally in a way that ensures doing business safely and properly in \\\\ncompliance with the laws and regulations applicable to NBE.\\\\n3.  NBE\\\\'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOD)\\\\nThe Board is fully responsible for governance, starting from inculcating the culture of governance \\\\nand approving a Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management that will serve as a guide \\\\nfor performing their daily duties, up to taking the necessary steps to communicate the objectives \\\\nand conduct that should be followed at NBE. At the same time, the best interest of all stakeholders \\\\nshould be protected. The Board also approves the standards and values which reflect NBE\\\\'s \\\\npolicies that should be followed by all employees, senior management and directors. This comprises \\\\nNBE\\\\'s strategies. In addition, the Board sets general objectives for executive officers and oversees \\\\nthe realization of such objectives. Furthermore, the Board verifies the effectiveness of internal \\\\ncontrols and risk management to ensure maintaining NBE\\\\'s reputation.\\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group73.1 BOARD COMPOSITION\\\\nThe Bank is managed by a Board that comprises a number of directors having diverse experience \\\\nand appointed by the Prime Minister\\\\'s decision, subject to the CBE\\\\'s current governance \\\\ninstructions, provided that the majority of the Board consists of non-executive members.  \\\\nThe salaries, allowances and remuneration of the Chairman and Board directors shall be \\\\ndetermined by the General Assembly.\\\\n3.2 NON-EXECUTIVE AND INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\\\\nNBE applies and practices governance, and ensures the presence of effective audit and budgeting \\\\nfunctions, allowing objective feedback on NBE\\\\'s activities and the decisions made by the Board. \\\\nThis can be achieved through maintaining the balance, independence and objectivity of its Board \\\\nby engaging both executive and non-executive directors who shall have the skills and experience \\\\nthat qualify each of them to express his/her opinion during the Board\\\\'s discussions independently, \\\\nresulting in proper decision-making.\\\\nNon-executive directors are those who are not full-time employees at NBE, do not receive any \\\\nmonthly or annual salary from NBE, and do not provide any paid consultancy. The Board discloses \\\\nin its annual report the names of all non-executive directors who are deemed independent from \\\\nmanagement and do not have any kind of relationship that may prejudice their objectivity in \\\\ndecision-making.\\\\nA NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS DEEMED INDEPENDENT IF S/HE:\\\\n. 1is not a former employee of, nor have a family relationship with any of the employees of, the \\\\nBank or any of its affiliated parties during the three years preceding nomination.\\\\n. 2does not have any personal interests or any relevant relations with NBE.\\\\n. 3does not have family relations with directors, senior management member or any of their \\\\nrelatives up to fourth degree.\\\\n. 4receives compensation only in the form of allowances for his/her representation in the Board \\\\nand Board committees.\\\\n. 5is not a major shareholder in NBE and does not represent it.\\\\n. 6is not a partner or employee of NBE\\\\'s external auditor during the last three years prior to the \\\\ndate of his/her nomination as director.\\\\n. 7has not been a director for more than six successive years.2\\\\n2-    This is according to the provisions of Articles 118 ,120, and 134 of the CBE and the Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020.\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group83.3 BOARD’S RESPONSIBILITIES\\\\nThe Board is mainly responsible for the management of NBE as well as identifying and achieving \\\\nthe strategic objectives of the Bank.

The Board of Directors \\\\nplays a significant role in direction and leadership, while the role of senior management is to \\\\nprepare and implement the relevant strategies and policies developed and approved by the Board. \\\\nMoreover, the Board and its members should act independently from senior management. There \\\\nshould be no relationships which may affect the objectivity of decision taking.\\\\nThe Board ensures that senior management actively applies the policies preventing and minimizing \\\\nthe activities, relationships or circumstances which may jeopardize NBE\\\\'s governance system. These \\\\ninclude, for example, conflict of interests, internal lending and preferential treatment for related \\\\nparties or certain institutions (e.g. soft-term loans which are not granted to other NBE customers, \\\\nwithout deviating from banking norms). Both the Board and senior management should understand \\\\nNBE\\\\'s organizational structure and transaction volume. \\\\nFurthermore, NBE has in place an organizational chart and a manual of instructions which clearly \\\\nstate the powers and responsibilities across the Bank. The manual includes the most important \\\\nbusiness procedures and the duties of NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management. Both the Board and \\\\nsenior management undertake the responsibility of instituting and underpinning professional and \\\\nethical standards, besides enhancing internal control culture. NBE shall design certain policies \\\\ncovering practices relating to such standards, ensuring the compliance of its staff with such policies.\\\\nNBE applies the principle of dual control. More than one person should jointly take vital decisions \\\\nto ensure objectivity and avoid conflict of interests. Senior management verifies that the relevant \\\\npolicies and strategies have been properly communicated to all NBE\\\\'s staff. In the meantime, the \\\\nBoard oversees senior management\\\\'s activities and assesses how far they are in compliance with \\\\nBoard\\\\'s policies. This is an essential part of checks and balances which should be available in an \\\\neffective governance system.\\\\nNBE sets appropriate supervisory positions in its organizational chart able to assume their \\\\nrespective responsibilities, in order to ensure effective supervision and control over all job levels \\\\nwhile accurately describing the authorities and responsibilities of each level, including: \\\\n. 1directors, in their capacity as members in the Board and its committees.\\\\n. 2senior managers.\\\\n. 3NBE’s functions of day-to-day work.\\\\n. 4heads of groups who directly oversee NBE\\\\'s various divisions.\\\\n. 5heads of NBE\\\\'s various divisions.\\\\n. 6NBE\\\\'s independent functions, such as Risk, Compliance, and Internal Audit and Inspection \\\\nGroups.\\\\n--- Page 23 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group22In addition, it is important to check that the right person is in the right place, to ensure that duties \\\\nare fully discharged. \\\\nBoard and senior management shall perform their duties according to the following \\\\nprinciples:\\\\n. 1Comply to the Central Bank and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020 and regulations and \\\\ninstructions issued as a result;\\\\n. 2Exert due diligence as per technical and professional customs.\\\\n. 3Collaborate with the Central Bank with credibility and transparency.\\\\n. 4Notify the Central Bank of any grave violations in the Bank.\\\\n. 5Verify that their duties are performed efficiently and effectively according to the applicable laws \\\\nand regulations. \\\\n. 6Ensure that their responsibilities are assigned to persons having the competency and authority \\\\nnecessary to perform the assigned duties, while assuming full responsibility for these duties. \\\\n. 7Exercise all due diligence to protect the interests of customers, providing them with fair \\\\ntreatment.\\\\n. 8Maintain disclosure and transparency upon providing information requisite for customers.\\\\n. 9Avoid any conflict of interest. \\\\n6. INTERNAL CONTROL\\\\n6.1 DEFINITION\\\\nInternal control is a process whereby all the Bank\\\\'s activities and operations are regularly \\\\nmonitored and reviewed by the Board, senior management, all NBE\\\\'s committees and employees \\\\nacting as part of the Bank\\\\'s internal control function.4\\\\n4-Pursuant to Article 121 of the Law of the Central Bank and the Banking Sector promulgated under Law No. 194 of 2020\\\\n--- Page 24 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group236.2 CULTURE\\\\nThe Board and senior management are responsible for setting and communicating the standards \\\\nnecessary for fostering internal control culture and establishing the control environment at the \\\\nvarious levels of management at the Bank, which makes all employees at all levels aware of the \\\\nnature of their respective roles and responsibilities in light of the Bank\\\\'s approved policy. The \\\\npolicies of the Bank and the Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management should reflect \\\\nthe ethical values of the Bank and/or the overall banking group, with the objective of reducing any \\\\nbreaches or abuses committed by the staff, which may cause financial and moral losses to the Bank.   \\\\n6.3 OBJECTIVES\\\\n. 1Ensure the efficiency of activities and operations management at the Bank in order to optimally \\\\nutilize resources and manage assets to avoid losses and maximize profits.\\\\n. 2Check consistency and compliance of the Bank\\\\'s activities and operations with a pplicable laws \\\\nand control rules, and their conformity with policies, procedures and bylaws of the Bank.\\\\n. 3Ensure the efficiency of risk management function and follow adequate procedures to control \\\\nand reduce risk.\\\\n. 4Verify the effectiveness of management information systems (MIS) to support timely decision-\\\\nmaking as well as adequate and accurate reporting.\\\\n6.4 NBE\\\\'S INTERNAL CONTROL ELEMENTS\\\\nThe integration of internal control elements is the cornerstone of success in achieving its \\\\nobjectives, especially regarding the protection of NBE\\\\'s assets against risks and the achievement of \\\\nthe relevant strategic objectives, according to the following:\\\\n. 1The effective role of the Bank\\\\'s Board and senior management;\\\\n. 2Consistency and effectiveness of internal control functions (Internal Audit and Inspection - Risk \\\\nManagement - Compliance).\\\\n. 3Adequacy of risk control systems.\\\\n. 4Efficiency of information systems and communication channels of the Bank.\\\\n. 5Efficiency of the adopted internal control procedures to ensure dual control and segregation of \\\\nduties.\\\\n. 6Review of internal control policies and procedures, periodical assessment of their effectiveness, \\\\nand adoption of the necessary corrective measures in this regard.\\\\n--- Page 25 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group24The organizational structure of the internal control functions is reviewed at least once annually by \\\\ninternal and external auditors.\\\\n6.5 BOARD\\\\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITORS AND OTHER \\\\nINTERNAL CONTROL FUNCTIONS\\\\nT o ensure having an effective governance system, cooperation is maintained between the Bank\\\\'s \\\\nBoard and the internal and external auditors in addition to NBE\\\\'s internal control functions \\\\n(Risk Group, Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group, and Internal Audit and \\\\nInspection Group). The Board and senior management shall make the best use of the deliverables \\\\nof the Bank\\\\'s Risk Group, Internal Audit & Inspection Group and Regulatory Compliance & \\\\nCorporate Governance Group as well as external auditors\\\\' notes and reports, in order to verify \\\\nthe information disclosed by the management regarding the validity of the Bank\\\\'s operations and \\\\nperformance.\\\\nOptimal use of the recommendations and comments of the departments/groups referred to above \\\\nhelps to verify the information disclosed by the management regarding the validity of the Bank\\\\'s \\\\noperations and performance.\\\\nWhen modifying its organizational structure, the Bank has observed the segregation of duties \\\\nof the departments/groups exposed to risk and the departments/groups monitoring such risk. \\\\nMoreover, the Bank\\\\'s existing committees are reorganized to avoid any conflict of interests and \\\\nwork independently. Direct contact should be maintained between each of the aforementioned \\\\nfunctions and the Bank\\\\'s Board and senior management. The Bank\\\\'s Board and senior management \\\\nare responsible for ensuring the availability of sufficient resources for internal control functions \\\\n(Risk, Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance and Internal Audit and Inspection) in \\\\naddition to hiring skilled and experienced employees in such departments to adequately meet \\\\ntheir needs and support these Groups to have readily available access to important reports and \\\\ninformation from different NBE divisions and branches\\\\n6.6 INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION (INTERNAL AUDIT AND INSPECTION GROUP)  \\\\nThe importance of internal audit function stems from ensuring the effectiveness and adequacy \\\\nof NBE\\\\'s internal controls and governance to provide a comprehensive insight to the Audit \\\\nCommittee, the senior management and Board on internal control and governance. In addition, \\\\nthe internal audit evaluates the efficiency and adequacy of the procedures adopted by the Bank\\\\'s \\\\ndifferent departments and business lines.\\\\nThe internal audit function is completely independent of other activities being reviewed, which is \\\\nreflected in the Bank\\\\'s organizational structure and the powers vested to it. This enables its staff to \\\\nfulfill the assigned tasks with full objectivity and impartiality. The internal audit department reports \\\\n--- Page 26 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group25directly to the Audit Committee, which submits its reports to the Board to ensure independence.\\\\nThe Bank shall develop an Audit Charter, which will be reviewed and updated periodically. The \\\\nCharter generally includes the objectives of the audit function and the tasks assigned to the Audit \\\\nDepartment and clearly identifies the powers and responsibilities of its staff.\\\\nPursuant to the provisions of Article ( 120) of the Central Bank and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of \\\\n2020 and the CBE’s internal control instructions dated September 2,2014, banks are committed to \\\\nobtain the CBE\\\\'s approval of the appointment of the Head/Director of Internal Audit in accordance \\\\nwith the relevant rules. Moreover, the Board shall approve the decision of resignation or removal \\\\nof the Internal Audit and Inspection Group Head for any reason, provided that removal reasons are \\\\ndisclosed and discussed with CBE.\\\\n6.6.1 MAIN FUNCTIONS OF INTERNAL AUDIT\\\\n1. Evaluate the adequacy of internal control systems approved by NBE\\\\'s senior management, \\\\nensure that appropriate review and continuous development and update of internal \\\\ncontrols, risk management procedures and compliance systems are properly carried out \\\\nin all NBE\\\\'s units and branches inside Egypt and abroad, report remarks and corrective \\\\nmeasures to the Audit Committee and/or the Board, and follow up the implementation of \\\\nthe relevant corrective measures.\\\\n2. Evaluate the compliance of NBE\\\\'s various activities and business units with the adopted \\\\nprocedures and policies.\\\\n3. Assess the effectiveness of the applicable procedures and policies and their consistency \\\\nwith business and market developments.\\\\n4. Follow-up the feedback and proposals reported by Internal Audit and Inspection Group \\\\nthrough the Manager of Audit and Inspection Follow-up Department with a view to \\\\nensuring that such feedback is sound and can consequently be reported. NBE\\\\'s Board and \\\\nsenior management will verify the significance of the feedback made by the Internal Audit \\\\nand Inspection Group, particularly such matters related to risk management and internal \\\\ncontrols through the following procedures:\\\\n4.1 continuously stressing the importance of internal audit and control functions and \\\\ncommunicating this vision to all NBE\\\\'s units to make sure that all NBE\\\\'s employees are \\\\naware of the importance and impact of such functions in the Bank.\\\\n4.2 timely and effectively making optimal use of the feedback made by the Internal Audit and \\\\nInspection Group; meanwhile, the senior management shall take the appropriate corrective \\\\nmeasures in time.\\\\n4.3 encouraging and enhancing the independence of internal auditors when conducting their \\\\naudit via the Bank\\\\'s organizational structure and the vested powers, which facilitates \\\\ndirect communication channels and direct reporting to Audit Committee for subsequent \\\\npresentation to the Board to ensure independence. This enhances their competencies \\\\n--- Page 27 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group26when discharging their duties with full objectivity and impartiality and encourages \\\\ntheir participation in judging the effectiveness of the Bank\\\\'s internal controls and risk \\\\nmanagement. It is also necessary to ensure that there is an easy access to important \\\\nreports and information from all NBE\\\\'s divisions.\\\\n5. Develop an annual internal audit plan that defines the minimum scope and frequency of the \\\\naudit and covers CBE\\\\'s instructions, to be approved by the Audit Committee.\\\\n6.6.2 INTERNAL AUDIT RELATIONSHIP WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES\\\\n CENTRAL BANK OF EGYPT:\\\\n. 1NBE\\\\'s management should maintain a communication channel between the Head of the \\\\nInternal Audit and Inspection Group and the CBE’s Control and Supervision Sector, to discuss \\\\nthe measures taken on the weaknesses and the Bank\\\\'s ways to address them.\\\\n. 2According to the instructions issued on governance, the Audit Committee should provide the \\\\nControl and Supervision Sector with a quarterly report to be discussed with the Board; and \\\\nidentify the corrective measures to be taken on a timely basis.\\\\n. 3The Bank\\\\'s management should notify the Control and Supervision Sector of the decisions, \\\\nfacts and developments that significantly affect its financial position, particularly the issues \\\\nthat require holding meetings between the Bank and the external auditors or the relevant \\\\nregulatory authorities. In the light of such information, the CBE shall consider participation in \\\\nsuch meetings.\\\\nEXTERNAL AUDITORS:\\\\n. 1The Internal Audit and Inspection Group should coordinate with the external auditors \\\\nespecially when holding discussions with the senior management, Board and Audit Committee \\\\non the recommendations about developing Internal Control in the light of Article 125 of the \\\\nCBE and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020.\\\\n. 2The Internal Audit and Inspection Group shall provide the external auditor with the necessary \\\\ninternal audit reports, highlighting key issues raised by the internal auditors that may be \\\\nimportant to the CBE.\\\\n. 3Efforts of internal audit and external auditors shall be coordinated and effective \\\\ncommunication channels are to be established to discuss risk-related activities, identified \\\\nweaknesses as well as the relevant procedures taken, and to understand risk management \\\\nstrategies adopted by the Bank.\\\\n6.6.3 AUDITING NBE\\\\'S FOREIGN BRANCHES & UNITS\\\\nNBE takes certain regulatory measures regarding its foreign branches and units \\\\nensuring that:\\\\n--- Page 28 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group27. 1The business activities of foreign units are consistent with the organizational and strategic \\\\nobjectives of NBE\\\\'s or the Group as a whole.\\\\n. 2All foreign units and branches comply with the applicable instructions at the host country \\\\nin addition to adhering to CBE instructions, particularly with regard to the rules of the \\\\npreparation and presentation of financial statements. In case of inconsistency, NBE\\\\'s foreign \\\\nunit/branch should notify the Head of Compliance and Corporate Go vernance Group- Head \\\\nOffice who, in turn, should notify CBE\\\\'s Control & Supervision Sector adequately to take the \\\\nnecessary action.\\\\n. 3Decision-making authorities are in line with the targets of the units and their operational \\\\ndivisions.\\\\n. 4Duties are segregated and the principle of dual control is effectively applied.\\\\n. 5Foreign units perform internal audit and send periodic reports thereon to the Bank\\\\'s H/O \\\\nAudit Department or the Group.\\\\n. 6The CBE’s Control and Supervision Sector is informed of all audit reports prepared on NBE’s \\\\nforeign branches and units by the host country\\\\'s regulatory authorities or auditors. \\\\n6.7 COMPLIANCE FUNCTION (REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND CORPORATE \\\\nGOVERNANCE GROUP)\\\\nThe compliance function is intended to establish and deepen effective, advanced and firm control \\\\npolicies, systems and tools to ensure NBE\\\\'s compliance with the existing rules according to the \\\\napplicable legislation and regulatory instructions at the local and international levels. This enables \\\\nthe Bank to face and control any potential risks of using NBE for illegal or suspicious purposes, \\\\nparticularly financial crimes including money laundering activities. NBE should, therefore, be well-\\\\naware of non-compliance risks. Such risks may include financial loss, legal or regulatory sanctions \\\\nand/or impaired reputation of the Bank, as a result of failure to comply with the applicable laws \\\\nor the rules and regulations issued by regulatory bodies inside Egypt and abroad. Accordingly, the \\\\nresponsibility for maintaining the Bank\\\\'s good reputation does not fall upon the Compliance Group \\\\nsolely; rather it is the responsibility of all NBE\\\\'s employees.\\\\nNBE\\\\'s senior management is responsible for devising Board-approved policies on the compliance \\\\nfunction and communicating them to all NBE\\\\'s staff.\\\\nThe Compliance Officer shall be independent, directly reporting to the Audit Committee and/or \\\\nthe Board.\\\\nCBE\\\\'s approval is to be obtained with regard to the appointment of the Compliance Officer \\\\nin accordance with the relevant regulatory instructions. Moreover, the Board shall approve the \\\\ndecision of resignation or removal of the Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance \\\\n--- Page 29 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group28Group Head for any reason whatsoever, provided that removal reasons are disclosed and discussed \\\\nwith CBE.\\\\n6.7.1 MAIN FUNCTIONS OF COMPLIANCE GROUP\\\\n1.Review the activities related to maintaining a database of laws and regulations issued by CBE in  \\\\n   addition to communicating the relevant information promptly to the parties concerned through  \\\\n   the following:\\\\n1.1maintaining a database of laws and regulations related to the banking business to be able to     \\\\n     review NBE’s policies and work procedures.\\\\n1.2supervising the revision of the Bank\\\\'s documents and forms in use and ensuring their  \\\\n     compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in addition to making the necessary  \\\\n     recommendations.\\\\n1.3coordinating with all divisions to ensure the adequacy of the applicable controls in the  \\\\n     performance of their transactions and tasks pursuant to the relevant laws and regulations and  \\\\n     measuring the effectiveness of such control in light of the application of a risk-based approach. \\\\n2.Proactively identify, evaluate and document the non-compliance risks associated with the Bank\\\\'s  \\\\n    activities and business.\\\\n3.Identify and prioritize the geographic regions and products which may be subject to non-  \\\\n    compliance risks that may jeopardize the Bank\\\\'s reputation or expose the Bank to legal or  \\\\n    regulatory sanctions or to financial loss.\\\\n4.Appropriately and timely incorporate the applicable laws and regulations and amendments  \\\\n    thereto into the Bank\\\\'s policies and procedures.\\\\n5.Review all instructions and correspondence sent from CBE and other regulatory authorities  \\\\n    addressed to the Compliance Group by the Chairman.\\\\n6.Examine new products to ensure their compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements  \\\\n     and controls.

In addition, the  \\\\n    Compliance Group shall work on preparing a plan to assess and audit the work of compliance,  \\\\n    covering all aspects of the Bank\\\\'s activities. This process is considered one of the audit tools and  \\\\n    techniques applied by the Compliance Group to help in planning, identifying priorities,  \\\\n     determining breaches, gaps and accomplishments/ recommendations and reaching an  \\\\n     agreement on the appropriate corrective measures with the relevant divisions.\\\\n14.Periodically and regularly assess the regulatory compliance, anti-money laundering (AML)  \\\\n     and/or counter finance of terrorism (CFT) procedures to examine the effectiveness of such  \\\\n     procedures and verify the application of the appropriate techniques to face the risks;\\\\n15.Evaluate several areas including managing conflict of interest and deliberate breaches, violating  \\\\n    instructions and laws, treating customers fairly and ensuring the suitability of customer advice  \\\\n     and disclosure.  \\\\n16.Act as a focal point with the regulatory authorities in obtaining any amendments to the  \\\\n     controls, approvals and exceptions and provide such regulatory authorities with the  \\\\n     compliance-related data, information and periodical reports.\\\\n17.Revise all compliance-related remarks in the reports of regulatory authorities and forward such  \\\\n    remarks to the competent divisions to take the necessary corrective measures and reply to the  \\\\n    remarks.\\\\n6.7.2 COMPLIANCE GROUP\\\\'S ROLE AS REGARDS FOREIGN BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES:\\\\n. 1Ensure maintaining effective communication with NBE\\\\'s foreign branches and subsidiaries to \\\\nconfirm their compliance with the local and international policies and pr ocedures. The Group \\\\nshall receive periodical compliance assessment report from foreign branches, to follow up the \\\\nperformance of evaluation and give instructions concerning the corrective measures to be \\\\ntaken, if necessary. Moreover, Compliance Group shall consider any conflict between local laws \\\\nand instructions and those applicable at the host country and report the same to the CBE\\\\'s \\\\nControl and Supervision Sector to prepare a memorandum of understanding (\\\"MoU\\\") in this \\\\nregard with the host authorities, if necessary.\\\\n. 2Continuously monitor the compliance of NBE\\\\'s foreign branches and subsidiaries with the \\\\nlocal and international policies, procedures, controls and laws.\\\\n. 3Evaluate and monitor the compliance of foreign branches and subsidiaries to ensure that \\\\ncompliance programs are strictly applied.\\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group30. 4Coordinate with foreign branches for ongoing control to spot breaches/ deficiencies with \\\\nregard to compliance with regulatory controls and propose corrective measures.\\\\n. 5Identify the deficiencies in the application of compliance program at NBE\\\\'s branches and units \\\\nand take the necessary corrective measures.\\\\n. 6Review the compliance periodic reports received from foreign branches and subsidiaries.\\\\n. 7Review internal and external audit reports on compliance and monitor the corrective \\\\nmeasures to be taken.\\\\n6.8 RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION (RISK GROUP)\\\\nNBE has a clear organizational structure that includes an independent function which is responsible \\\\nfor risk management and clearly identifies the persons to be accountable for risk management \\\\nalong with their duties and responsibilities, particularly the authorities and duties of Risk Group \\\\nHead. It is essential to apply the segregation of duties principle to avoid any conflict of interests, \\\\nwhile maintaining direct contact between Risk Management Group and the Risk Committee \\\\nand the Board. It also emphasizes that the Head of Risk Group shall not undertake any financial \\\\nor management responsibilities that might conflict with his/her position as Risk Group Head. \\\\nAdditionally, the non-executive directors should be keen on meeting with the Risk Group Head on \\\\na regular basis in the absence of executive directors.\\\\nThe appointment of the Risk Group Head shall be subject to the CBE\\\\'s approval. Moreover, the \\\\nBoard shall approve the respective decision of resignation or removal of the Risk Group Head for \\\\nany reason, provided that removal reasons are disclosed and discussed with CBE in accordance \\\\nwith the relevant regulatory instructions.\\\\n6.8.1 MAIN FUNCTIONS OF RISK MANAGEMENT\\\\n. 1Analyze potential risks, mainly credit, market and operational risks, while ensuring that the said \\\\nanalysis is accurately and timely performed.\\\\n. 2Identify a specific work flow for risk measurement, monitoring, and control, ensuring that \\\\napproved contingency plans are put in place (business continuity plan (BCP), liquidity plan, etc.).\\\\n. 3Continuously gauge the adequacy and effectiveness of the work flow for risk measurement, \\\\nmonitoring, and control; and make any relevant amendments, if necessary, according to the \\\\ndevelopments in the market and the changes in NBE\\\\'s work environment.\\\\n. 4The policies approved by the Board should contain acceptable risk exposures which will be \\\\nreviewed and evaluated periodically by the Risk Committee and the Board. Such exposures \\\\nshould be consistent with NBE\\\\'s risk appetite and capital amount, taking into account \\\\nrisk measurement and management in the Bank in general. Appropriate actions shall be \\\\ntaken in case of any deviations from the relevant policies. Additionally, there should be \\\\nseparate departments/divisions for each type of major risks (e.g. credit risk including retail \\\\n--- Page 32 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group31banking, market, operational risks, etc.) reporting to Risk Group, with defined authorities, \\\\nresponsibilities and duties. The segregation of duties between regulatory and executive \\\\nfunctions is essential to avoid conflict of interests.\\\\n. 5NBE should have a proper and effective information flow and communication system that \\\\nbetter serves risk monitoring and control. NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management, as well as Risk \\\\nCommittee, should be timely provided with proper information and periodic reports, at least \\\\non a quarterly basis, that reflect NBE\\\\'s compliance with acceptable risk exposures, as well as \\\\nthe reports that indicate non-compliance with such acceptable risk exposures, detailing the \\\\nreasons and the corrective measures.\\\\n. 6 NBE should have in place an effective risk control and analysis system, taking into account \\\\nthe nature of its business activity and the volume of its transactions, in order to assess different \\\\ntypes of risk. Such system should include:  \\\\n6.1 identifying all types of risks whether quantitatively measurable or unmeasurable, and \\\\ndefining internal and external risk elements.  \\\\n6.2 having in place a risk management framework which comprises evaluation forms, approved \\\\nrisk limits and the bases for monitoring risk. Such forms should be regularly reviewed and \\\\ndeveloped. \\\\n6.3 regularly reviewing NBE’s total risk matrix, particularly credit (corporate and retail) risk, \\\\nmarket risk and operational risk.  \\\\n6.4 regularly following-up and evaluating the system to ensure that NBE’s internal risk \\\\nmanagement procedures are in line with market conditions and to develop the appropriate \\\\nbanking prudential standards.\\\\n. 7Risk management policies should include a specific stress testing mechanism as one of the \\\\ntools used by the Bank\\\\'s risk management. This mechanism should be developed specifically \\\\nand clearly, particularly with respect to the frequency and conditions under which testing is \\\\ncarried out, the utilized methods, the appropriate risk assumptions and factors, time periods, \\\\ndifferent scenarios for all types of risk including worst case scenarios, and the scope of testing. \\\\nDocumenting procedures should be determined and quarterly reports presented to the senior \\\\nmanagement, Risk Committee and the Board which should, in turn, evaluate the delivered \\\\nfindings and take the necessary prudential procedures or decisions in this regard. \\\\n. 8The Group should provide early warning indicators to help identify and manage factors related \\\\nto major risks. \\\\n. 9Management reports are to be presented in a clear and understandable manner which enables \\\\nNBE\\\\'s directors to evaluate the reported risks and take the appropriate decisions in this \\\\nregard, particularly in relation to the results of stress tests.  \\\\n--- Page 33 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group327. EXTERNAL AUDITOR\\\\nThe external auditor function is important as it provides confirmation and assurances to the Board \\\\nthat the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations \\\\nand the Egyptian and international reporting standards and accurately represent the Bank\\\\'s financial \\\\nposition and performance with regard to all financial aspects.\\\\nThe external auditor must comply with the highest professional standards. The approval of \\\\nthe Audit Committee should be obtained prior to contracting an external auditor to provide \\\\nconsultancy or services other than auditing the Bank’s financial statements. The external auditor \\\\nshould be completely independent of the Bank\\\\'s functions and directors to avoid any conflict of \\\\ninterests.\\\\nThe appointment and/ or removal of the external auditor shall be subject to the recommendation \\\\nof the Audit Committee. Such recommendation shall be submitted to the general assembly to take \\\\nits decision with respect to approving the appointment and/ or removal of the external auditor.\\\\n7.1 BOARD\\\\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL AUDITOR\\\\nNBE\\\\'s Board ensures that there is direct contact between the external auditors and the Audit \\\\nCommittee to which they will directly report.\\\\nThe Audit Committee plays an effective and important role with respect to the relationship with \\\\nexternal auditors by supervising their work and directly contacting them. The Audit Committee \\\\nassumes direct responsibility for the following:\\\\n. 1Nominate and/ or remove, and determine the fees and remuneration of, external auditors.\\\\n. 2Approve the scope of the audit to be performed with external auditors.\\\\n. 3Receive audit reports and ensure that NBE\\\\'s management takes the necessary corrective \\\\nmeasures in time in relation to the problems identified by external auditors, other internal \\\\ncontrol deficiencies and weaknesses and non-compliance with the approved policies and \\\\napplicable laws.\\\\nBoth NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management contribute to enhancing external auditors\\\\' role and \\\\nensuring that the financial statements reflect NBE\\\\'s sound performance in all important aspects \\\\nand show NBE\\\\'s real financial position. NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management can support external \\\\nauditors\\\\' role through ensuring that: \\\\n. 1External auditors comply with the currently applicable professional practices and standards.\\\\n. 2Audit verifies NBE\\\\'s internal controls in relation to disclosure of the financial statements.\\\\n--- Page 34 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group33. 3External auditors understand and are fully aware of their liabilities towards the Bank, especially \\\\npracticing due diligence to complete the audit process.\\\\n. 4Non-executive directors hold meetings with the external auditors (excluding senior \\\\nmanagement) in the presence of the heads of the Internal Audit and Inspection Group and \\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group, at least once a year.\\\\n8. DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY\\\\nHaving in place a mechanism for disclosure and transparency strengthens the efficiency and \\\\nviability of NBE’s business. Keen on the application of professional transparency and disclosure \\\\nstandards, NBE ensures accurate, full and timely disclosure of all important financial and non-\\\\nfinancial information of the Bank, taking into account the volume and complexity of its operations, \\\\nownership structure and risk appetite. All NBE\\\\'s stakeholders have to be aware of the Bank\\\\'s \\\\nstrategies and have access to adequate information in order to evaluate its performance.\\\\nNBE provides many communication channels to exchange information such as: annual report, \\\\nreports to regulatory authorities and NBE’s website.\\\\n8. 1MAIN RULES OF TRANSPARENCY ADOPTED BY NBE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED \\\\nTO, DISCLOSURE OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION\\\\n. 1Structure and composition of NBE\\\\'s Board.\\\\n. 2Responsibilities, experience and qualifications of NBE\\\\'s Board.\\\\n. 3NBE\\\\'s ownership structure.\\\\n. 4NBE\\\\'s organizational structure; for example, overall organizational structure, business functions, \\\\naffiliated and associated companies and the Board\\\\'s committees and their responsibilities.\\\\n. 5Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management.\\\\n. 6NBE\\\\'s policies in relation to conflict of interests, insider transactions and dealings with affiliated \\\\nand associated parties.\\\\n. 7NBE\\\\'s policy on governance practices.\\\\n. 8NBE\\\\'s policies regarding employees\\\\' compensation and benefits, including directors\\\\' and senior \\\\nexecutives\\\\' remuneration, disclosing the total amount paid to the top twenty collectively \\\\n(including salaries, allowances, fringe benefits and any other cash benefits).\\\\n. 9Policy on NBE\\\\'s corporate social responsibility and related actions.\\\\n. 10 Disclosure of financial statements approved by the independent external auditor, and the \\\\nnotes to the accounts which show NBE\\\\'s financial performance and position according to the \\\\nCBE’s Rules of Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements and the relevant governing \\\\n--- Page 35 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group34laws and legislation; and \\\\n. 11 Disclosure of the effective interest rates and banking tariffs in accordance with Article No. \\\\n88 of the Law of Central Bank and Banking Sector promulgated under Law No. 194 of 2020 \\\\nand the relevant instructions issued by regulatory authorities.\\\\n. 12 Disclosure by directors about their representation/membership in BoDs of affiliated \\\\ncompanies/entities.\\\\n9. TIGHTENING CONTROL OVER THE COMPLEX \\\\nSTRUCTURES/TRANSACTIONS IN LINE WITH \\\\nGOVERNANCE PRACTICES\\\\nNBE is keen to avoid the unjustifiable legally-complex transactions that may jeopardize the \\\\nprinciple of transparency. The Bank also avoids involvement in vaguely structured transactions that \\\\ncurb the Board\\\\'s ability to effectively supervise such type of NBE\\\\'s business.\\\\nThe Bank\\\\'s Board is also keen on ensuring the full awareness and understanding of NBE\\\\'s \\\\nstructure, affiliated entities and related risks. NBE\\\\'s Board thoroughly perceives any prospective \\\\ncomplex transactions or products and ensued risks. Moreover, NBE realizes the necessity of \\\\nadopting clear policies and procedures to overcome such risks along with taking appropriate \\\\nmeasures to mitigate their consequences. This includes understanding the connection between \\\\nthese entities and the Bank, as well as the legal and operational risks related to this structure, \\\\nrelated-party transactions and the effect of these factors on NBE\\\\'s financing approach, capital, and \\\\nrisk level in both favorable or unfavorable circumstances and on the reputation of NBE\\\\'s Group \\\\nas a whole. Risks that may arise out of these complex structures/ transactions are controlled \\\\nthrough:\\\\n. 1Having in place a clear and documented centralized mechanism for approving and monitoring \\\\nstructures and when forming new affiliated legal entities.\\\\n. 2Periodically monitoring the appropriate application of the adopted policies, procedures and \\\\nlimits.\\\\n. 3Ensuring the consistency and adherence of such structures/ transactions to the laws and \\\\nregulatory controls to be followed by the Bank.\\\\n. 4Providing accurate information regarding the structure of the Bank as a whole in terms of \\\\ntype, characteristics, ownership structure and nature of activities, for each affiliated legal entity \\\\nseparately.\\\\n. 5Obtaining adequate information concerning such structures/ transactions and the associated \\\\nrisks and recognizing the risks that can be imposed by the complexity and overlapping \\\\nstructure of the Bank or the Group, including lack of transparency and operational risks \\\\nresulting from the complicated organizational structure particularly in legal terms, provided \\\\nthat they are reported to the Bank\\\\'s Board and disclosed to CBE. The disclosed information \\\\nshould include the purpose, amounts, strategies, risks of such transactions and the relevant \\\\n--- Page 36 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group35control mechanisms, ensuring that information regarding these transactions are properly \\\\ndisclosed.\\\\n. 6Internal audit officers of each affiliated entity shall regularly present a report to the Bank\\\\'s \\\\nAudit Committee evaluating the group structure-related risks, so that such complex \\\\nstructures/ transactions can be monitored and controlled. It is also necessary that periodic \\\\nreports containing the most significant feedback and deviations from the adopted policies and \\\\nprocedures shall be submitted to the Bank\\\\'s Board, Risk Committee and senior management.   \\\\n10. CODE OF ETHICS FOR NBE\\\\'S STAFF AND SENIOR \\\\nMANAGEMENT\\\\nThe Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management serves as a general statement clarifying \\\\nthe professional and ethical standards applicable in the Bank. All employees shall comply with all the \\\\ncontents of the Code of Ethics. The employee is fully responsible for its contents, as he/she signs \\\\nan acknowledgment of compliance with the Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management \\\\nbefore starting work. The Code of Ethics shall be regularly reviewed. Any amendments to this Code \\\\nwill be communicated to all employees who shall be given the appropriate training in this regard. \\\\n Any failure to abide by the instructions mentioned in the Code of Ethics is considered a serious \\\\nviolation and may expose the employee to disciplinary actions which may include the termination \\\\nof his/her employment. All employees should, therefore, comply with the contents of the Code. \\\\nRegardless of their locations and ranks, all NBE\\\\'s employees must immediately report to the Ethics \\\\nOfficer any violations resulting from behaviours or practices that are thought to be incorrect, \\\\ninappropriate or unethical according to the Whistleblowing and Whistle-blower Protection \\\\nPolicy. It should be known that any reports on actual or potential violations in the Bank will not \\\\nbe ignored. If the employee involved in these violations reported them, it would be taken into \\\\nconsideration during the investigations. The Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance \\\\nGroup shall coordinate with the Internal Audit and Inspection, Legal Affairs and HR Groups to take \\\\nthe necessary corrective measures according to the consequences of such violation.\\\\nThe Compliance Officer is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with all the local and \\\\ninternational regulatory instructions, as well as NBE’s internal policies and procedures.\\\\nThe Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group is responsible for regularly \\\\nreviewing and updating the Code of Ethics as well as ensuring its consistency with the Bank\\\\'s new \\\\npolicies and procedures and the relevant regulatory and legal changes.\\\\n--- Page 37 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group3611.  WHISTLEBLOWING AND WHISTLE-BLOWER \\\\nPROTECTION POLICY\\\\nNBE is keen to provide a sound and constructive working environment based on ethical values that \\\\nenhances integrity, accountability and transparency.\\\\nNBE\\\\'s Whistleblowing Policy aims at providing a safe channel for the employees so as to eliminate \\\\ntheir fears and to assure them that they will be protected against any retaliation or harm as a \\\\nresult of reporting any violations. The policy provides protection to whistle-blowers who report \\\\nany violations that do not comply with the Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management.\\\\nThis policy accordingly assists senior management to unveil any corrupt or illegal behaviour, so that \\\\nthe necessary procedures can be taken. This will curb such violations and contribute to creating a \\\\nsound work environment that promotes employees\\\\' ethical values.\\\\n12. CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY:\\\\nConflict of interest is a situation in which an employee or one of his/her family members has a \\\\nmaterial or moral interest which conflicts with the employee’s position or job requirements such \\\\nas integrity, independence and protection of public money, or realizes illicit gain for the employee \\\\nor any third party. Any employee should disclose any such conflict to the Regulatory Compliance \\\\nand Corporate Governance Group to take the necessary actions to prevent the occurrence of any \\\\ndamage to the Bank.\\\\nConflict of interest occurs when employee\\\\'s own interest overlaps somehow with the Bank’s \\\\ninterest. Such conflict clearly emerges when the employee uses practices that serve the best \\\\ninterest of himself/herself, or one of his/her family members. This also happens when the employee \\\\ngives his/her acquaintances or relatives a privileged treatment over other customers by abusing his/\\\\nher position in the Bank, including, for instance, extending loans or reducing due commissions and \\\\ninterests in contradiction with the relevant instructions and controls.\\\\nConflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, the following; any other case of conflict \\\\nof interest which is not included below shall be reported to the Regulatory Compliance and \\\\nCorporate Governance Group Head:\\\\nDeals and transactions with external parties\\\\nEmployees or their relatives up to the second degree may not, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell, \\\\nlease out any property in favour of the Bank, or offer any outsourcing or supply services for the \\\\nBank\\\\'s requirements, unless there is no conflict of interest that may achieve direct benefit to the \\\\nemployee. Such transaction shall benefit the Bank and be arranged on a fair basis. \\\\n--- Page 38 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group37No employee may, personally or by proxy, apply to the Bank’s tenders or bids. The Bank shall not \\\\npurchase any items from, nor assign any business to, any employee. No employee may, personally or \\\\nby intermediary, enter any kind of auction unless the sold items will be purchased by employees for \\\\ntheir own usage and they are offered for sale by entities other than the Bank, which are not subject \\\\nto the Bank’s supervision. Notwithstanding the above, the Bank may approve otherwise.  \\\\nAny transaction between the Bank and any employee in which there is a personal gain to the \\\\nemployee or any business relationship whatsoever, other than banking services, between the Bank \\\\nand any relative of an NBE employee up to the second degree shall be reported to the relevant \\\\nGroup Head and the Compliance Officer at the Head Office.\\\\nBorrowings and advances\\\\nNo amounts of money (i.e. personal advances) may be lent or borrowed by any NBE employee \\\\nfrom other employees, third parties (such as existing customers or suppliers) or any other NBE-\\\\nrelated third parties.\\\\nBorrowing shall be made from financial institutions.\\\\nTransactions of benefit to any NBE employee or any of his/her relatives or friends\\\\nNBE’s employees shall not be involved in any collateral, evaluation or approval processes in respect \\\\nof any loans or similar transactions between NBE and their relatives, in-laws or friends.\\\\nBanking transactions\\\\nEmployees are prohibited from processing orders/transactions on their personal accounts or the \\\\naccounts of their relatives up to the third degree (i.e. processing the application/transaction, not \\\\npresenting the application. For example, a teller withdraws money from his/her account through \\\\nthe teller’s till or a transfer officer processes a personal transfer using his/her PIN code).\\\\nStaff accounts\\\\nNBE staff accounts are to be used to credit monthly salaries and process normal personal \\\\ntransactions of employees only. All types of personal accounts shall not be utilized as an \\\\nintermediary account for the transactions of any other party. Such account may not be utilized for \\\\ncollecting amounts of money. No NBE staff account shall be utilized by a third party for banking \\\\ntransactions (receiving deposits or transfers) in favour of other persons.\\\\nLegal powers of attorney \\\\nNBE’s employees may not issue/accept any legal or personal powers of attorney (PoA) to process \\\\nbanking transactions. The approval of Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group \\\\n--- Page 39 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group38Head must be obtained prior to issuing PoAs (by or for) NBE\\\\'s employees.\\\\nEmployees’ investments (stock markets/securities)\\\\nEmployees are allowed to trade securities in public subscriptions and carry out buy and sell \\\\ntransactions pursuant to the following controls:\\\\nProhibited use of insider information:\\\\n. 1Employees may not, by virtue of their positions or the nature of their duties, use insider \\\\ninformation for their own benefit or for the benefit of others, or disclose such information to a \\\\nthird party, directly or indirectly.\\\\n. 2No employee may trade a security if s/he (trader) has a direct or indirect access to relevant \\\\nmaterial information and knows that such information exists but not announced. Employees \\\\nmay not disclose such information to any other party unless it has an established legal capacity \\\\nthat authorizes such access.\\\\n. 3It is prohibited to disclose material insider information to any person (Tipping Off), including \\\\nfamily members who may in turn buy or sell securities, or transfer such information to another \\\\nperson who may buy or sell securities.\\\\n. 4Employees may trade on the stock exchange, subject to notifying the Regulatory Compliance \\\\nand Corporate Governance Group and   undertaking to present the relevant statements of \\\\naccount from Misr for Clearing, Settlement and Depository (MCSD) with respect to such \\\\ntrades upon the Bank’s request.\\\\n. 5Employees shall comply with the relevant laws and regulatory controls.\\\\nEngagement in outside employment\\\\nEmployees are prohibited from working for other entities, acting as directors in any companies/\\\\nassociations or partners in any business, engaging in consultancy business or self-employment \\\\nincluding part-time job (whether paid or not), unless a prior written consent is obtained from the \\\\nrelevant Region/Group Head and the Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group \\\\nas well as the consent of the Chairman or his substitute. \\\\nMoreover, it is prohibited to engage in fraudulent marketing activities (i.e.a fraudulent investment \\\\nscheme to persuade some individuals to contribute a certain sum of money to raise funds, \\\\npromising them to receive a commission/return if they can persuade others to participate, which 5\\\\n5-  Insider information: any material information that is not announced to public traders and related to the business of a \\\\ncompany whose securities are traded, or any of its related parties or entities.\\\\nMaterial information: information that has a tangible impact on the price of the offered or tradable security, the investment \\\\ndecisions of traders, or trading trends in the market.\\\\n--- Page 40 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group39ends in failure when new people stop to join).\\\\nUsing or exploiting the Bank\\\\'s name or logo in personal matters \\\\nIt is prohibited to print any papers, documents or publicity material (e.g. agendas, calendars, pens, \\\\nflash memories, etc.) or purchase notebooks or prints bearing the Bank\\\\'s logo from any third \\\\nparty, which shall be carried out only through the relevant division at the Bank.\\\\nIt is also prohibited to use the Bank\\\\'s logo for any reason outside the scope of business without \\\\nreferring to the relevant divisions.\\\\nDealing on arm’s length basis with all parties\\\\nAll NBE’s employees shall observe the principles of fairness and objectivity in dealing with all \\\\ninternal parties (colleagues, superiors and subordinates) and external parties (customers, suppliers \\\\nand competitors). \\\\nAccordingly, NBE’s employees should not unfairly receive any personal gain or privileges from such \\\\nparties through manipulation, concealment, deceit or improper use of information and data to \\\\nwhich they have access due to the nature of their work at NBE.\\\\nConflict of Interest Policy and Directors\\\\nDirectors shall take due diligence to serve the best interest of the Bank, taking into account \\\\ntwo key factors: first, observing the Bank’s interests with honesty and good faith for the utmost \\\\nbenefit of the Bank while exercising due diligence and care; second, remaining loyal to the \\\\ninterests of beneficiaries and depositors by dealing with them on arm’s length basis, monitoring \\\\nthe transactions of affiliated or related parties, being keen on avoiding any conflict of interests, and \\\\nrefraining from taking or participating in any decision in case a potential conflict of interest exists \\\\nwith the director’s duties or responsibilities.\\\\nThe Board approves the policies on managing conflict of interest and oversees their application \\\\nto the Board, executive management, staff and any other party directly/indirectly related to NBE. \\\\nThese policies include, but are not limited to:\\\\n• Directors/senior executives should disclose to the Board any direct/indirect financial interest \\\\nfor their benefit/on behalf of third parties in relation to any transactions/matters having direct \\\\nimpact on the Bank.\\\\n• A director, in his/her personal capacity or as a representative of third parties, may neither act \\\\nas a director nor engage in management or consultancy roles in another bank or credit firm.\\\\n• The Bank may not offer finance, advances, credit facilities or guarantees of any kind to its \\\\nchairman, directors, auditors, or their spouses or second-degree relatives;

NBE\\\\'S SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ROLE \\\\n• NBE supports Egypt\\\\'s future vision which is in agreement with the global sustainable \\\\ndevelopment goals (SDGs) under which man attains development with an eye to achieving \\\\neconomic and social development and welfare of Egyptians in all aspects of their daily life. T o \\\\nthis end, the Bank has developed a growing interest to participate in meeting the healthcare, \\\\neducational and economic needs of Egyptians as well as achieving slums development. NBE \\\\nplays this vital role in order to produce a positive impact on the Egyptian society. The Bank \\\\nexerts incessant efforts to directly reach out to targeted beneficiaries to make a remarkable \\\\ndifference in the life of Egyptians. This is demonstrated by the large number of social \\\\n--- Page 42 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group41responsibility projects undertaken by NBE. Being the oldest Egyptian bank with the greatest \\\\ncontributions to the national economy, NBE in fact deserves to be \\\"The People\\\\'s Bank\\\". NBE \\\\ntook the lead as one of the first banking and economic institutions to r ealize the significance of \\\\nits role in serving the community.\\\\n• Over the previous years, NBE\\\\'s contributions were mainly directed to healthcare, education, \\\\nand combating poverty. In addition, NBE made significant contributions to support disabled \\\\npeople and to promote culture, protect our heritage and support breadwinning women.\\\\n14.

These principles define rules and procedures that achieve the optimum \\\\nprotection and balance between the interests of directors, shareholders and \\\\nstakeholders.  \\\\n \\\\nThese rules should be seen to complement companies\\\\' articles of incorporation, \\\\nespecially joint stock companies , limited and general partnerships with shares  and \\\\nlimited liability companies  incorporated under Law 159 /1984, Capital Market Law \\\\n95/1992 and relevant executive regulations and decrees.  \\\\n \\\\nThese principles are unique and separate from legal stipulations. They extend \\\\nbeyond legal provisos. They form guidelines  for the correctly and proper conduct of \\\\ncorporate management, according to international practice and standards that \\\\nachieve an equitable arrangement of stakeholders\\\\' interests. These principles are \\\\nstraightforward. They are guidelines, explained thoroughly, without resorting to \\\\njargon, legalese or abstract rules. \\\\n \\\\nThough they do not carry the weight of legal enforcement as such, their pertinence is \\\\nmuch greater. Egyptian companies and shareholders who strive to implement and \\\\nabide by these principles are doing so for the sake of their companies and the overall \\\\ninvestment climate. They are embracing the spirit of the era: openness and \\\\ntransparency. Moreover, auditors and legal consultants are encouraged to take up \\\\nthe significant role of urging directors to abide by these principles and monitor their \\\\nimplementation. Banks, financial institutions and credit rating agencies should \\\\nconsider companies\\\\' compliance with these principles during evaluation.  \\\\n \\\\nWe hope directors of companies, financial institutions, professional committees and \\\\nshareholders will introduce and promote these principles, using them as a yardstick \\\\nto measure their achievement.  \\\\n \\\\n 4\\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\n1 Scope of Implementation \\\\n \\\\n1.1 These rules are primarily applicable to joint stock companies listed on the \\\\nstock market, especially those being actively traded. Also they apply to financial \\\\ninstitutions with a joint stock company st ructure. Many partners own this type of \\\\ncompany. The relationship between owners and directors should be clearly stated. \\\\nThey are also applicable to companies that directly impact the public. Included in this \\\\ncategory are companies mainly financed by banks as compliance with corporate \\\\ngovernance ensures creditors\\\\' rights.  \\\\n \\\\nCorporate governance principles are dev eloped to accommodate companies formed \\\\nunder Law 159/1984 covering joint stock companies, partnerships formed through \\\\nthe allocation of shares and limited liabilities companies, companies operating under \\\\nCapital Market Law 95/1992 and the CASE rules governing the listing and cancelling \\\\nof securities.  Therefore, whenever the words \\\"company\\\" or \\\"companies\\\" are \\\\nmentioned in these principles, they refer to CASE listed companies as well as \\\\nfinancial institutions adopting a  joint stock company form, even if not listed on CASE. \\\\nThe latter group includes banks, insurance, mortgage finance and securitization \\\\ncompanies as well as companies funded by banks. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.2 Corporate governance principles are vital for all companies. Other companies \\\\nmay be considered in the initial stages before being listing or offered for public \\\\nsubscription. Corporate governance principles briefly include items applicable to \\\\nclosed joint stock companies, limited liability companies and individuals\\\\' companies. \\\\nWhile this may contradict principles in other countries, Egypt is justified to do this as \\\\nonly 2.5% of Egyptian companies are listed on CASE.  \\\\n \\\\n1.3 Developments in the Egyptian economy and the stock market, especially in \\\\nrecent years, indicate that many clos ed joint stock companies will be listed on CASE \\\\nin the future. Thus, it is important that companies\\\\' shareholders and directors pay \\\\nattention to corporate governance principles, in preparation for listing on the stock \\\\nmarket. Proper qualification for public offering or listing is a main goal of corporate \\\\ngovernance. Therefore, shareholders, creditors and staff will benefit from \\\\nencouraging and monitoring companies\\\\' compliance with these principles as much as \\\\npossible even if they are not listed.   \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.4 Applied properly, corporate governance do not merely mean respecting and \\\\nliterally interpreting a set of rules. It is a culture and practice governing the \\\\nrelationship between company owners, directors and stakeholders. The wider the \\\\nscope of implementation, the greater the benefits for society as a whole.  \\\\n 5\\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\n2- General Assembly  (or General Meeting) \\\\n \\\\n2-1 The General Assembly (GA) comprises shareholders, each according to his \\\\nshare. While a company\\\\'s bylaws may stipulate that GAs are attended only by \\\\npartners holding shares, this provision should be considered an exception to the \\\\ngeneral rule entitling shareholders to attend GAs. It is effective only when the number \\\\nof shareholders cannot be accommodated. However, it should not be a way to ignore \\\\nor exclude small shareholders.   \\\\n \\\\n2-2 Shareholders should be encouraged to attend GAs. The date and place of \\\\nmeetings should be publicized.  \\\\n \\\\n2-3 Agenda items should be explained clearly to help shareholders make \\\\ndecisions. Information should be provided to help shareholders to make sound \\\\ndecisions and not as a formality.  \\\\n \\\\n2-4 General Assemblies should be managed in a manner that allows \\\\nshareholders to express their opinions . The management should fully and clearly \\\\ndisclose all items on the agenda.  \\\\n \\\\n2-5 Voting on general asse mbly motions should be recorded accurately.  Where \\\\nmotions are contested, a ll votes in fa vour of the motion and all those ag ainst shou ld \\\\nbe counted and recorde d. Then the decision s should be sub mitted to the appropriate  \\\\nadministrative or legisla tive bodies. The rules fo r general assemblies sh ould be \\\\nobserved at all times.   \\\\n 6\\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n3- Board of Directors \\\\n \\\\n3-1 The general assembly appoints the joint stock company\\\\'s board of directors \\\\nto manage the company. Board members are absolutely responsible regardless of \\\\nwhether they form committees or authorize other parties or individuals to undertake \\\\nassignments.  \\\\n \\\\n3-2 The board comprises representatives selected from different groups of \\\\nshareholders. Once appointed, a board member the director is considered a \\\\nshareholders’ representative and should commit to work in the best interests of the \\\\ncompany, and not just for the group he/she represents or those who voted for \\\\nhim/her. \\\\n \\\\n3-3  Egyptian laws stipulate that the board is elected to represent shareholders \\\\nand that it should be proportionally representative according to capital distribution. \\\\nNevertheless, voting rules entitle the majority group in the general assembly to \\\\nappoint all members by voting for each nominee individually. Therefore, proper \\\\ncorporate governance imposes a cumulative method of voting when electing the \\\\nboard. Capital distribution should be considered so that the final result is proportional. \\\\nEach nominee should present his CV to shareholders.  \\\\n \\\\n3-4  The board should comprise a majority of non-executive directors with the \\\\ntechnical or analytical skills to benefit the board and the company. All of the non- \\\\nexecutive directors should dedicate the time and attention necessary to fulfil their \\\\nobligations to the company and not to accept assignments that could be seen to be a \\\\nconflict of interest.  \\\\n \\\\n3-5  New board members should have access to information, data and full \\\\nexplanations. This provides a full picture of  the company\\\\'s activities, administrative \\\\nstructure, budget, strengths and weaknesses – helping them to perform efficiently.  \\\\n \\\\n3-6  The board appoints the chairman and the chief executive officer. Preferably \\\\none person should not combine both positions. If deemed necessary, reasons should \\\\nbe stated in the annual report. In this case the deputy chairman should be non-\\\\nexecutive.  \\\\n \\\\n3-7 The board should supervise the company closely. It should not delegate this \\\\ntask to others.  \\\\n \\\\n3-8 The board should set out rules, regulations and procedures ensuring the \\\\ncompany\\\\'s compliance with existing laws and regulations, rules and \\\\ninformation disclosure to shareholders, creditors and stakeholders. \\\\nCompliance with laws and information disclosure should be objective at all \\\\ntimes.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 7\\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n3-9 The Board’s a uthorization and that of others should be prompt and clear.  \\\\nThe deadline for submitting results to the board should be specified. The board \\\\nshould not issue general or tardy authorizations as they diminish the board’s \\\\nauthority.  \\\\n \\\\n3-10 Company\\\\'s information and data should be available to members whenever \\\\nand however required.  \\\\n \\\\n3-11  Board members may seek external advice and the company should expect to \\\\nremunerate its advisors.. Majority approval in compliance with relevant regulations \\\\nshould precede commissioning advice. \\\\n  \\\\n3-12 The company should remunerate the execut ive directors to attract the best \\\\ncalibres in the market. A committee, with a majority of non-executives may be formed \\\\nfor this purpose. The committee is entitled to propose executives\\\\' remuneration and \\\\nnegotiate with them in consultation with the chief executive officer. The final decision \\\\nshould be left to non-executive members. The names of the committee members \\\\nshould be announced in the annual report. The GA chairman should attend the \\\\nannual meeting to answer shareholders\\\\' questions in this regard. \\\\n \\\\n3-13 Executive members\\\\' payments, incl uding salaries, allowances, in-kind \\\\nbenefits, incentive shares and other financial items should be disclosed.  \\\\nPerformance-related payments should form the largest portion to motivate members’ \\\\nimprovement.   \\\\n \\\\n3-14 Incentive shares should be not given to motivate members to make sound \\\\ndecisions at the short-term only. They should be related to medium and long-term \\\\nimprovements.  \\\\n \\\\n3-15 The terms of e xecutive members\\\\' contracts should not exceed three years, \\\\nunless there are specific circumstances, which should be announced at the GA \\\\nmeeting.  \\\\n \\\\n3-16 The committee references in 3-12 should propose non-executives\\\\' payments. \\\\nto the GA. Discrepancies in payments should be avoided if possible and if not, they \\\\nshould be based on defined tasks or activities.   \\\\n \\\\n17-3 The board should meet at least once every 3 months. The number of \\\\nmeetings and names of absentees should be announced in the annual report.  \\\\nMeetings should be scheduled for members’ convenience.  An agenda should be \\\\ncirculated before the meeting. An exception is special meetings for urgent business. \\\\nIn such cases, executives or director s who are capable of explaining the topic \\\\nthoroughly and responding to questions should attend. Resolutions should not be \\\\npassed except when an ordinary meeting is not possible. In this case voting should \\\\nbe confined to urgent resolutions. Resolutions should be passed unanimously.  \\\\n \\\\n18-3 Non executive members may meet directors for consultation. These meeting \\\\nmay or may not be attended by executive members who should be informed about \\\\nthe time and agenda.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 8\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\n19-3 The board should review internal regulations and procedures for their \\\\nappropriateness and efficiency regularly. The board is entitled to access of all \\\\ninformation, financial and non-financial reports.   \\\\n \\\\n20-3 The board may form committees to undertake certain tasks for specified \\\\nperiods. Such committees are considered complementary to the board and not a \\\\nmeans to discharge the board from its responsibilities or transfer responsibility to \\\\nanother party.  \\\\n \\\\n21-3 Formation of the board-affiliated committees follows general procedures set \\\\nby the board including its mandate, duration and authority. The supervision of these \\\\ncommittees should be included in procedures. Committees should inform the board \\\\nopenly about their tasks, outcomes and decisions. The board supervises the \\\\ncommittees\\\\' activities periodically to ensure adherence and functionality.   \\\\n \\\\n22-3 An internal audit committee formed from  a number of non-executive members \\\\nshould be assigned to check internal controls and the company\\\\'s working practices.   \\\\n \\\\n23-3 Non-executive members, preferably, are included in committees appointed by \\\\nthe board. Such committees are chaired by non-executive members. Committees \\\\nmay seek the assistance of external advisors at the company\\\\'s expense. The annual \\\\nreport should include a brief summary covering the form of each committee, number \\\\nof meetings, assignments and achievement s. GA meetings should be attended by \\\\ncommittee chairmen.  \\\\n \\\\n24-3 The board appoints a secretary to manage files, minutes and reports. Unless \\\\nasked to leave the meeting, the secretary attends the GA meetings. Members may \\\\ncontact the secretary between meetings. The secretary\\\\'s role extends beyond the \\\\ntraditional functions, proscribed in Egyptian law, such as attending meetings and \\\\npreparing minutes.

Nevertheless, corporate governance \\\\nmay be implemented in all companies, achieving a balance of interests and a new \\\\nmanagement culture. Therefore, the greater  the number of companies abiding by \\\\nthese principles, the higher is the probability of promoting the interests of society, \\\\nshareholders and stakeholders. \\\\n \\\\nSpecifically, closed or family-held jo int stock companies and limited liability \\\\ncompanies should adhere to these rules as closely as is possible.  \\\\n \\\\nIndividuals\\\\' companies should avoid conflict of interests and impose rules of internal \\\\ncontrol. The independence of legal and financial advisors and should be ensured.  \\\\nSocial policies should be disclosed.  \\\\n \\\\nIf corporate governance is not applicable to  closed or family-held joint stock \\\\ncompanies and limited li ability companies, they should have other less- costly \\\\nalternatives that suit their financial and administrative capacit y, while achieving the \\\\nsame results.  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 15\\\\n    content_length: 22737\\\\n    word_count: 3337\\\\n    processing_timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:41:17.003704\\\\n    status: success\\\\n\\\\n  -     filename: oih-board-summary-eng.pdf\\\\n    filepath: C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\amros\\\\\\\\Downloads\\\\\\\\iVolution\\\\\\\\data\\\\\\\\oih-board-summary-eng.pdf\\\\n    file_extension: .pdf\\\\n    mime_type: application/pdf\\\\n    metadata:       size_bytes: 114602\\\\n      created_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:25.887207\\\\n      modified_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:26.451197\\\\n      file_hash: df7f4bf1c20b45d6ede3139501c9f044c0585af85122108ccc9d561bdaded7d2\\\\n\\\\n    content: --- Page 1 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nOrascom Investment Holding S.A.E.  \\\\nEstablished pursuant to the provisions of Law 95/1992  \\\\nHead Office: Nile City Towers, South Tower,  \\\\n2005 A corniche El Nile, Ramlet Beaulac, 11221, Cairo, Egypt  \\\\nCommercial register number: 394061 Cairo  \\\\n \\\\nSummary of Board of Directors Resolutions by Circulation  \\\\n10 June  2024  \\\\nOn June 10,  2024 , upon the invitation of the Chairman, Eng.

Such a study is important \\\\nbecause the critical role a board plays in the success of a firm merits an in -depth research \\\\non different factors that link a boar d to a firm performance. The research approach adopted \\\\nin this research includes GLS random effect regression over the nine year test period which \\\\ntest for the existence of the proposed relationship between board characteristics and firm \\\\nperformance. This study will reflect the impact of the recent developments in the corporate \\\\ngovernance in Egypt on corporate performance from 2004 which is considered the year of \\\\nissuance of the Egyptian code of corporate governance till 2012. The sample used in the \\\\nstudy i s based on the 50 most active Egyptian companies listed in the Egyptian stock \\\\nmarket; these companies are considered the best reflection for the Egyptian market. The \\\\nfindings from this research provide evidence that there is a positive relationship between  the \\\\nproportion of independent directors on the board and firm financial performance as \\\\nmeasured by ROE, board meetings results showed a positive significant relationship with \\\\nROE, CEO duality showed a significant positive relationship with ROE, and the director \\\\nownership is positively associated with firm performance as measured by ROE, but the \\\\nrelation is not significant.

Introduction  \\\\n \\\\nIn the past decades very little attention was grabbed towards corporate governance and boards of \\\\ndirectors; they were only handled by some management teaching, researc h and popular writing. The \\\\nterm Corporate Governance was not even used until well in to the 1980s. However, beginning in the \\\\n1980s and continuing and growing within the 1990s, corporate governance received increasing attention \\\\namong practitioners, academic s and other groups.  \\\\n* \\\\nEarly at this century, some major corporate meltdowns received extensive media attention; like Enron, \\\\nWorldCom and Adelphia began to receive more attention than before. Yet, corporate governance was \\\\nbeing noticed even before those me ltdowns. Further, the major corporate scandals that happened \\\\nraised much corporate issues such as the role of† board of directors in monitoring management \\\\nperformance.  \\\\n  \\\\n                                                           \\\\n**Mr. Mrwan Amer, Lecturer  in Accounting and Finance, College of Management & Tech., Arab Academy for Sciences & \\\\nTech., Egypt, PhD student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, Email:  mrwan.amer@gmail.com      \\\\n**Prof. Dr. Ai man Ahmed Ragab, Dean of College of Management & Tech., Arab Academy for Sciences & Tech., Egypt, E \\\\nmail: aaragab@aast.edu     \\\\n***Dr. Mohamed A .

They can aid  in linking the \\\\nfirm to its environment, provide secure critical resources (Williamson, 1996; Hillman et al., 2000), and \\\\ncontribute actively in a firm‟s strategic  decision making (Fama  & Jensen, 1983, Davies, 1999; Kemp, \\\\n2006). Another important role of bo ards is to act as a mechanism of internal governance and monitoring \\\\nof management (Barnhart, Marr & Rosenstein, 1994; Shleifer  & Vishny, 1997). A board performing \\\\nthese roles effectively is likely to facilitate superior firm performance (Hawkins, 1997; Gom pers, Ishii, &  \\\\nMetrick, 2003). The critical role a board plays in the success of a firm merits an in -depth research on \\\\ndifferent factors that link a board to a firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n2. Description of the Existing Egyptian Governance  \\\\n \\\\nBoards in the Egyptian comp anies seemed to be a one -tier structure; meaning that one single board \\\\ncomprising executive and non -executive directors. Such type of board structure is predominant in \\\\ncountries such as the UK, the USA and the majority of EU Member States (Mallin, 2007). H owever, in \\\\nEgypt, boards lack the rules that govern their structure from executive or non -executive directors. The \\\\nconcept of „non -executive director‟ was firstly introduced in the 2002 listing rules.  As stated in the \\\\nEgyptian code of corporate governance  “The BOD should include a majority of non -executive members \\\\nwith an appropriate mix of skills, technical, or analytical experience that is of benefit to the board or \\\\ncorporation.”  \\\\n \\\\nEgyptian companies often practice CEO duality; where only one person plays both roles: the chairman \\\\nand the CEO. The board member responsible for the executive management is sometimes called the \\\\nmanaging director or the chief executive officer. This means that the CEO is responsible for the running \\\\nof the board as well as the run ning of the company‟s business. As stated in the Egyptian code of \\\\ncorporate governance  “The BOD undertakes the designation of the chairperson and managing director; \\\\nit is preferred that the two posts not be held by the same person.\\\"  \\\\n \\\\nAs for the board size,  the board of directors is usually composed of an odd number of members, at least \\\\nthree.  The annual general assembly is responsible for electing directors on the board for a period of \\\\nthree renewable years, setting their remuneration, and removing them if necessary. Directors must \\\\nsubmit their resume, including a list of companies with which they have been related during the previous \\\\nthree years. For an employee to be recruited as a director, he/she must have been serving the company \\\\nfor at least two years.  In case the company experiences losses, board members cannot be re -\\\\nappointed.  \\\\n \\\\nBoard meetings are held upon the request of either the chairman or two -thirds of the members. A board \\\\nmeeting is considered valid only if the number of attendees is not less th an half of its members plus one, \\\\nwhere the number of attendees must be at least three. Despite this, there is no disclosure of board \\\\nmeeting attendance. The board is fully responsible to the shareholders. In this essence, the board of \\\\ndirectors‟ main respo nsibility falls in supervising the implementation of the company‟s objectives as \\\\ndecided by its general assembly. In light of such responsibility, the board of directors perform many \\\\nfunctions; including inviting the shareholders to meet, investing the com pany‟s funds, requesting loans, \\\\nappointing executive managers and submitting financial statements and board reports to the general \\\\nassembly meeting.  \\\\n--- Page 3 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n2 \\\\n As stated in the Egyptian code of corporate governance  “The board should convene no less than once \\\\nevery t hree months. The number of conventions and the names of the members who failed to attend the \\\\nmeetings of the board or its sub -committees will be revealed in the corporation‟s annual report.”  \\\\n \\\\n3. Literature review and hypothes es development  \\\\n \\\\nBasically the boar d should be the main mechanism of internal governance and monitoring of \\\\nmanagement (Barnhart et al. 1994; Shleifer and Vishny 1997). An effective and strong board could aid \\\\nfirm performance economically. As it can link a firm to its environment, secure cri tical resources \\\\n(Williamson 1996; Hillman et al. 2000), and significantly affects the firm‟s strategic decision making \\\\n(Fama and Jensen 1983; Davies 1999 and Kemp 2006). Hence, such a board would likely help the firm \\\\nto improve performance (Hawkins 1997; G ompers et al. 2003).       \\\\n \\\\n3.1 Board Independence  \\\\n \\\\nUp till the 1960s boards in the United States were mostly composed of internal directors. But since then \\\\nand up to the current situation, firms have had more predictable wisdom that turned board compositi on \\\\nto be mostly composed of external directors. (Bhagat  & Black, 2002).  Hermalin and Weisbach (1988) \\\\nand Bhagat and Black (2002) found that firms experiencing poor performance were more likely to \\\\nincrease the proportion of outside directors than better per forming firms, signifying a contraction of \\\\nmonitoring in order to lessen agency problems. However, neither author found that improved \\\\nperformance stemmed from these changes. Hill and Snell (1988) found that the proportion of outside \\\\ndirectors on the board and profitability were positively associated. Similarly, Brown and Caylor (2004) \\\\nfound that a board whose the majority of its members are independent directors helps the firm to \\\\nachieve higher returns on equity, higher profit margins, larger dividend yield s, and larger stock \\\\nrepurchases. Nonetheless, Hermalin and Weisbach (1991) concluded from their study that there isn‟t \\\\nany significant impact of the insider/outsider ratio of boards on Tobin‟s Q. Accordingly;  they argued that \\\\ninsiders and outsiders were mo re-or-less equivalent in affecting firm performance. Also, Agrawal and \\\\nKnoeber (1996) found that the existence of more outsiders on the board was linked to higher levels of \\\\ndebt financing and lower levels of firm performance.  John and Senbet (1998) argued that a board \\\\nhaving more non -executive directors (NEDs) is considered to be more independent. Yet, relating this to \\\\nfirm performance yielded mixed or inconsistent results in different empirical studies. In one breath, it is \\\\nasserted that executive (inside)  directors are more familiar with a firm‟s activities and thus are more \\\\ncapable of monitoring top management. On the other hand, it is contended that NEDs are treated as \\\\n“professional referees” to ensure that competition among insiders stimulates actions c onsistent with \\\\nshareholder value maximization (Fama, 1980). Weisbach (1988) and Cotter et al. (1997) supported this \\\\nview emphasizing that outside directors play a critical role in protecting shareholders‟ interest through \\\\neffective decision control. Still,  some authors didn‟t identify any significant relationship between \\\\nproportion of NEDs and firm performance (Hermalin and Weisbach, 1991; Bhagat and Black, 2002). It \\\\nhas been rather shown that the effectiveness of a board depends on the optimal mix of insid e and \\\\noutside directors (Fama and Jensen, 1983; Baysinger and Butler, 1985; Baysinger and Hoskinsson, \\\\n1990; Baums, 1994). However, available theory is inadequate on the determinants of optimal board \\\\ncomposition (Weisbach, 2002). We measure the independence  of the board by finding the ratio of NEDs \\\\nto board size and we expect this to have a positive relationship with firm performance. Subsequently we \\\\ntest the following hypothesis:  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 4 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n3 \\\\n H1: Greater independence of the board of directors is associated with higher  firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n3.2 Board Size  \\\\n \\\\nIt has been a debate, from many perspectives, whether the board is preferred to be of a large size or \\\\nsmall size (Jensen 1993; Yermack, 1996; Dalton et al., 1999; Hemalin  &Weisbach, 2003). While some \\\\nfavored smaller boar ds to improve firm performance (e.g., Lipton &Lorsch, 1992; Jensen 1993; \\\\nYermack, 1996) others have recommended that larger boards are better for enhancing firm performance \\\\n(Pfeffer, 1972; Klein, 1998; Adam &  Mehran, 2003; Anderson et al., 2004; Coles et a l., 2008). For \\\\nexample; Lipton &Lorsch, 1992 went for smaller boards claiming that they would help the firm to avoid \\\\nsocial loafing and free -riding. Jensen, 1993 added that smaller boards usually ease co -ordination, \\\\ncohesiveness and communication. This mat ches O‟Reilly et al., 1989 view which declared that with the \\\\nincrease in board size, the effectiveness of interpersonal communication decreases, and coordination \\\\nproblems seem to be obvious, which would most probably develop factions and conflicts. Also, e arlier \\\\nstudies; Yermack (1996) and Eisenberg et al. (1998) have practically proven that smaller boards are \\\\nlinked to higher firm value.  \\\\n \\\\nOn the other hand, larger boards were seen beneficial on the ground that they enable advice to CEO \\\\nand superior monitor ing of management (Pfeffer, 1972; Klein, 1998; Adam &  Mehran, 2003; Anderson \\\\net al., 2004; Coles et al., 2008). Klein (1998) argued that the more the organization becomes complex, \\\\nthe more the CEO will need advice. Klein further added that advisory needs o f CEO also increase as \\\\nlong as the firm‟s dependence on environmental resources increases. In this essence, increasing board \\\\nsize helps businesses to manage the environment (Pfeffer, 1972; Pearce & Zahra, 1992). Furthermore, \\\\nthe agency theory supports larg er boards for their monitoring effectiveness that is developed by limiting \\\\nthe domination of the CEO within the board and protecting shareholders interests (Singh &  Harianto, \\\\n1989).  \\\\n \\\\nHermalin and Weishbach (1998) argued that board independence; which mainl y depends on the \\\\nnegotiations between the board and the CEO, promotes board effectiveness. Accordingly, in larger \\\\nboards, the bargaining position of the board becomes stronger against the CEO and thus, enabling the \\\\nboard to monitor management more effectiv ely. Further, a larger board will also ease the creation of \\\\ncommittees to delegate specialized responsibilities.  From the resource dependency theory perspective, \\\\nboards are chosen to maximize the provision of important resources to the firm (Pfeffer, 1972;  Pfeffer  & \\\\nSalancik, 1978; Klein, 1998; Hillman &  Dalziel, 2003). Recalling the demonstration shown previously by \\\\nKlein (1998) concerning the advisory needs of the CEO in case of increased dependence on \\\\nenvironmental resources, increasing board size links the organization to its external environment and \\\\nsecures critical resources. In response to resource dependencies and regulatory pressures, \\\\norganizations create large boards to encompass directors from different backgrounds (Pfeffer, 1972; \\\\nPearce & Zahra, 1992).  \\\\n \\\\nFinally, to sum up, while the smaller boards provide a greater room for CEO domination of board \\\\nresulting in agency costs, larger boards benefit firms by providing effective oversight of management, \\\\nenabling the firm to opt the available necessary resources and allowing for representation of different \\\\nstakeholders in the firm. This makes larger boards more beneficial in improving firm performance. \\\\nConsequently, this research proposes the following hypothesis:  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n4 \\\\n H2: There is positive relationship betw een board size and firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n3.3. CEO Duality  \\\\n \\\\nLeighton and Thain (1993), and Lechem, (2002) highlighted that the board Chair plays a significant role \\\\nin the decision making as well as the effectiveness in monitoring the management while the later  being \\\\nheaded by the Chief executive. However, in many cases, these two positions are merged making only \\\\none person in charge to build a unified leadership. Actually, stewardship theorists supported this view \\\\nreferring to it as CEO duality, arguing that it  enhances the effectiveness of leadership in organizations \\\\n(Finkelstein &  D‟Aveni, 1994). On the other hand, agency theorists went for the separation of the two \\\\npositions to ensure the effective monitoring of management.  Determining which of separation or CEO \\\\nduality would be better for a firm is being investigated by different studies producing mixed results. For \\\\nexample, Lipton and Lorsch (1993), Worrell, Nemec and Davidson (1997), and Carlsson (2001) \\\\nopposed CEO duality claiming that it compromises the m onitoring role of the board due to conflict of \\\\ninterest. They asserted that in case of a strong CEO, CEO duality would make the board insufficient and \\\\npowerless. Lorsch and MacIver (1989) have raised the question of whether directors are pawns or \\\\npotentate s in front of the CEO. Moreover, Rechner and Dalton (1991) concluded that firms where CEOs \\\\nhave a dual role usually have less performance than those without CEO duality.  \\\\n \\\\nIn contrast, other studies like Anderson & Anthony, 1986; Donaldson & Davis, 1991, an d Charan, 1998 \\\\nsupported CEO duality. They argued that separating the chairman and CEO positions would prevent the \\\\nfirm from having the unified focus of its energies which are vital in realizing the organizational goals. \\\\nThey declared that a CEO serving th e chairman position as well will have full authority over the firm that \\\\nwould aid improving firm performance. Boyd (1995) found that duality actually led to better performance \\\\namong the US firms. Nevertheless, another set of scholars (Daily & Dalton, 1997;  Dalton et al., 1998; \\\\nWeir & Laing, 1999,  Abdullah, 2004) have not detected any effective difference between the firms with \\\\nCEO duality and those without.  In a recent meta -analysis, Rhoades et al. (2001) provided support for \\\\nthe emergencies view that the f ramework of the study moderates the relationship between CEO duality \\\\nand firm performance. For instance, CEO duality and firm performance are positively related in the anti -\\\\ntakeover studies and negatively related in the compensation studies. Focusing on th e importance of \\\\ncontext on the study of CEO duality, Rhoades et al. (2001) stated “our findings highlight the value of \\\\nstudying the situations when  two heads are better than one, rather than exploring whether two heads \\\\nare better than one . Obviously furthe r research is required to increase our understanding on this \\\\nmatter”.  In US firms, CEO duality is as high as 80 – 84 per cent (Lorsch& MacIver, 1989; Core et al., \\\\n1999; Vafeas, 1999). According to Rechner, 1989, when al l the power is conc entrated in the ha nds of \\\\nCEO, the board turns to be „a rubber‟.  The CEO duality most probably would raise agency problems, \\\\nlimiting the effectiveness of board in management monitoring (Jensen, 1993; Strickland, Wiles &Zenner, \\\\n1996). It is also considered an obstacle to boar d‟s flexibility in performing one of its main duties of \\\\nreplacing a poorly performing CEO (Goyal  & Park, 2002) and is allied with too much compensation \\\\n(Core et al., 1999).  \\\\nBy the way, Hence, CEO duality is likely to unfavorably affect firm performance. Gi ven that, this \\\\nresearch proposes the following hypothesis:  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n5 \\\\n H3: CEO duality is negatively associated with firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\n3.4 Board Meetings  \\\\n \\\\nConger et al. (1998) has referred to board meetings as a critical resource for improving the board \\\\neffective ness. Likely, Vafeas, 1999 viewed the strength of board activity as a significant value -relevant \\\\nboard attribute. Actually, the frequency by which board members meet; to discuss the different issues \\\\nraised against the firm, strongly influences the effectiv eness of the board. (Vafeas, 1999; Carcello, et al., \\\\n2002). Conscientious boards are able to improve the level of supervision, resulting in better firm \\\\nperformance. For a board to be diligent, however, board meeting is not the only important aspect; other \\\\naspects are rather important; such as preparation before meetings, attentiveness, and participation \\\\nduring meetings and post -meeting follow -up \\\\n(Carcello et al., 2002). Though, board meeting is the only noticeable and publicly documented aspect.  A \\\\npriori , the nature of the relationship between board activity intensity and firm performance is not clear. \\\\nYet, many studies  asserted that board meetings are beneficial to shareholders, and  emphasized the \\\\nimportance frequency of these board meetings. For instance, Zahra and Pearce (1989) speculated that \\\\neffective meetings are crucial for successful board performance. Similarly, Vafeas (1999) argued that \\\\nincreased board meetings map the intensity of board activity and concluded a significant relationship \\\\nbetween boar d meetings and firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\nLipton &  Lorsch, 1992 and Byrne, 1996 recommended that the more frequent a board meets, the higher \\\\nthe likelihood of performing its duties diligently to protect shareholders interests. In this study it was \\\\nstated that  “the most widely shared problem directors face is lack of time to carry out their duties”. Also, \\\\nBeasley et al. (2000) observed that fraud records increase at firms that have less number of audit \\\\ncommittee meetings. And, Lawler et al. (2002) found that board practices are positively related to firm  \\\\nperformance. On the contract, Uzun  et al.  (2004) did not detect any significant  difference in board \\\\nmeetings, whether or not the firm is involved in fraud records.  Also, from the agency perspective, the \\\\nboard is pri marily responsible for monitoring management to be able to diminish agency costs and \\\\nappropriation by the managers. And, the Effectiveness of boards can be enhanced by meeting \\\\nrecurrently (Latendre, 2004) and signifying greater diligence (Carcello, et al.,  2002). On the other side, \\\\nVafeas  (1999) recommended that for monitoring an agency to maintain good governance, increasing \\\\nfrequency of board meetings would be easier than changing any of the other board characteristics, like, \\\\ndirector ownership or gender diversity. Lawler et al. (2002) demonstrated the positive relationship \\\\nbetween effective board practices and firm performance.  \\\\n \\\\nAs concluded empirically, board meetings are considered a resource that would lead to board diligence. \\\\nAlso, increased board mee tings is beneficial for the board as it provides more time for directors to \\\\ndiscuss, set strategy, and monitor management effectively. Increasing meetings frequency is relatively \\\\nless expensive than changing other board characteristics to not only protect shareholder value but also \\\\nto improve firm performance. In regard of this conclusion, the following hypothesis has been developed:  \\\\n \\\\nH4: Board meetings are positively associated with firm performance  \\\\n \\\\n3.5 Director Ownership  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n6 \\\\n Berle and Means (1932) outpointe d a relationship between ownership and firm performance, \\\\nrecommending that firms going public should separate ownership from control. Fama  & Jensen, 1983 \\\\nsupported this view stating that ownership separation improves professionalism through management \\\\nproficiency and firm -specific knowledge.  This view is however opposed by the agency theory which \\\\nreveals that separating ownership from control generates conflict of interests (Berle  & Means, 1932), \\\\nwhich in turn leads to expropriation by managers (Fama, 1980;  Shleifer  &Vishny, 1997). While \\\\nstockholders are concerned with maximizing the value of the firms, managers might be only considering \\\\nhow to develop their personal wealth and prestige. These diverse interests between shareholders and \\\\nmanagers incur agency costs that require the provision of monitoring mechanisms by the boards of \\\\ndirectors (Fama  & Jensen, 1983). The agency theory suggested that aligning the interests of the \\\\nmanagers more closely with those of shareholders/owners; by increasing managers‟ stoc k ownership, \\\\nwould help minimize the potential conflict (Jensen &  Meckling, 1976). Joining the ownership and control \\\\nthrough meaningful director stock ownership would probably lead to better management monitoring \\\\n(Elson, 1996). Such alignment of interests would lessen the need for monitoring and mitigating agency \\\\ncosts.  \\\\n \\\\nOn the other hand, McGregor (1967) argued that that conflict might be eliminated if an individual \\\\nidentifies with an organization and then intentionally directs his efforts towards the orga nizational goals. \\\\nDavis et al. (1997) supported this view pointing out that there isn‟t inherited conflict between managers \\\\nand shareholders. The author rather posited a fact, that managers at professional levels are highly \\\\ncommitted to the organization an d its goals, whereas shareholders might only be concerned with short \\\\nterm returns. Moreover, Fama (1980) and Shleifer and Vishny (1997) declared that there is a positive \\\\nlink between reputation and compensation of directors. The importance of reputation fo r directors lies in \\\\nhelping them in career growth and compensation. As stated by (Elson, 1996), in many cases, effective \\\\nperformance of directors is further compensated or rewarded by means of granting stocks.  \\\\n \\\\nEmpirically, many studies indicate that manag erial ownership improves firm performance (e.g., Jensen \\\\n& Murphy, 1990; Chung & Pruitt, 1996; Palia  & Lichtenberg, 1999). Brickley et al. (1988) argued that \\\\nmanagers and board members owning stocks are more motivated and keen to run the firm efficiently \\\\nand to control managers carefully. However, other studies were not so obvious about the relationship \\\\nbetween managerial ownership and firm performance. De Angelo and De Angelo (1985) followed the \\\\nagency theory perspective mentioning that high level of manage rial ownership will entrench \\\\nmanagement and create agency problems. Morck et al. (1988) and Shleifer and Vishny (1997) \\\\nanticipate the potential of exploitation of firm results by management to favor themselves. Becht et al. \\\\n(2005) argue that stock options might allow CEOs to enrich themselves and expropriate shareholders. \\\\nSome other scholars find that managerial ownership is endogenously determined (Demsetz  & Lehn, \\\\n1985; Loderer  & Martin, 1997; Cho, 1998).  \\\\n \\\\nIn spite of some questionable results, there is an  extensive number of studies supporting the notion that \\\\ndirector ownership helps in aligning the owners‟ and the management in terests, and provides a way of \\\\nmonitoring risk taking behavior of managers (Fama , 1980 ; Jensen and Meckling, 1976; Bebchuk, et al. , \\\\n2002; Chung and Pruitt, 1996; Core, Holthausen  & Larcker, 1999; Becht et al., 2005). Also, as argued \\\\nby Shleifer  &Vishny, 1996, aligning interests could alleviate free -ride problem of monitoring to boost \\\\nboard effectiveness. Nonetheless, the stewardship theory denies the existence of conflict of interests \\\\nbetween directors or managers and shareholders. It rather argued that both of them unite their interests \\\\nwith organizational goals (Donaldson & Davis, 1994; Davis et al., 1997).  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n7 \\\\n  \\\\nTherefore, it could be depicted that firm performance would be improved if directors and shareholders‟ \\\\ninterests are aligned through director ownership. Accordingly, the first hypothesis for this study states \\\\nthat: \\\\n \\\\nH5: Director Ownership is positively associated with firm perfo rmance.  \\\\n \\\\n4. Conceptual framework  \\\\n \\\\nThis section will explore various board characteristics that are expected to have an effect on firm \\\\nfinancial performance based on the literature review that was illustrated earlier.  Figure 1.1 presents the \\\\nconceptual framewo rk of this study. On the left hand -side, there are the listed board  characteristics \\\\nnamely, board independence, board meetings, CEO duality, director ownership, and board size. These \\\\nvariables are related to the firm performance, shown on the right hand si de, which is measured by return \\\\non equity, return on assets and Tobin‟s q. The relationship between board characteristics and the firm \\\\nperformance is controlled by firm size, firm age and firm leverage.  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n8 \\\\n Independent Variables          Dependant  \\\\n  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n5.

Furthermore, \\\\ntargeting the most active 50 companies ensures both statistical power in the tests and maximum data \\\\navailability. These companies cover about 15 industries, banks, and financial institutions are omitted as \\\\nthis sector has particular governance  issues which make it different from all other sectors (Faccio and \\\\nLasfer , 2000).  Firms‟ samples covered industries like Building material and construction , chemicals, \\\\nCommunication,  industrial goods and services and automobiles,  Entertainment and tourism , food and \\\\nbeverage , housing  and real estate, and information  technology.  Through doing this, a sample of 56 \\\\nEgyptian firms was obtained for a period of nine years.  \\\\n \\\\nThe sample selected represent firms which are considered top enterprises in Egypt, they are  likely to \\\\nhave greater potential to attract and employ competent and skilled individuals on the board and in the \\\\nsame way to gain a pay -off from such well -constructed board besides it is expected that these firms \\\\nhave good access to capital and other reso urces that are necessary not only for survival but also for \\\\nenhancing their performance.  \\\\n \\\\n5.2 Data collection  \\\\n \\\\nThe data for this study comes from multiple sources of secondary data. The base data comes from the \\\\nannual disclosure book issued by  the Egyptian  stock exchange  (EGX) . This book identifies the most \\\\nactive listed companies in Egypt & contains data on board characteristics, ownership structure, \\\\ncorporate performance & other related variables.  This book contains the annual reports of the 50 most \\\\nactive companies listed in Egypt\\\\'s stock exchange of that year. The annual reports were used in \\\\ncalculating the variables of board characteristics and firm performance. For this research, the disclosure \\\\nbooks for years 2004 –12 were used.  The use of the financia l statements of the most active companies \\\\nis due to data availability & reliability because these are required by law & are issued by the Egyptian \\\\ncapital market authority.  \\\\n \\\\n6. Results and discussion  \\\\n \\\\n6.1 Descriptive statistics  \\\\n \\\\nThe descriptive statistics for  all variables are presented in Table 2. This study sample shows a high \\\\npercentage of independence in the board of directors – at around 65%. This percentage shows a \\\\nrelatively high compliance rate with the Egyptian corporate governance recommendations on board \\\\nindependence of maintaining a majority of non -executive directors on the board. The average board \\\\nmeetings is about 4 times (mean = 4.44), which is the minimum number of meetings as recommended \\\\nby the ECCG. Also, the study shows that 71.42% of our sa mple has the same person as the chairman \\\\nof the board and the CEO, which is against the Egyptian corporate governance recommendations where \\\\nit is recommended that the positions be split into two roles or, in other words, that the two roles should \\\\nbe held b y two different persons. In most of the firms in the sample, top management appears not to \\\\nhave significant ownership, with a mean of 8.5%. This is considered a relatively small percentage. The \\\\naverage board size is about 9 members (mean = 9.33). The board  size in Egypt appears to be smaller \\\\nthan the board size in the US (eg mean size of 11.45 in Bhagat & Black, 2002) but larger than the size \\\\nof boards in Australia (eg mean size of 6.6 in Kiel & Nicholson, 2003). The board size in Egypt is larger \\\\nthan in th e UK as stated by Peasnell et al. (2005), who reports a mean board size of around 8 members.  \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n11 \\\\n  \\\\nTable 2: Descriptive statistics  \\\\nVariables*  Mean  Std. \\\\nDev.

The correlation coefficients are checked for the presence of high \\\\ncollin earity amongst regressors. Table 3 presents the Pearson correlations with the ROA; table 4 \\\\npresents both the Pearson correlations with the ROE; and Tobin‟s Q will be presented in table 5. \\\\n \\\\nFrom the correlation coefficients shown in table 3, 4 and 5, no hig h correlation is found amongst the \\\\nvariables. As a result, collinearity does not appear to create a threat to the interpretation of regression \\\\ncoefficients of the independent variables in this model.

Conclusion  \\\\n \\\\nThe overall  aim of this research is to interpret the relationship between the board characteristics and \\\\nthe firm performance represented by the ROA, ROE and Tobin‟s Q. Inconsistent with the first \\\\nhypothesis that states there is a positive relationship between the pro portion of independent \\\\ndirectors on the board and firm financial performance as measured by ROE , ROA and Tobin‟s Q , the \\\\nresults showed that there is a positive but not significant relationship with ROE , ROA  and Tobin‟s Q ; \\\\nthis implies that the outside inde pendent directors cannot influence firms‟ financial performance.  This \\\\nstudy finds that board size (second hypothesis) is positively and significantly associated with ROE \\\\nand ROA, which is consistent with this study‟s argument, but this hypothesis is not su pported for the \\\\nTobin‟s Q.  \\\\n \\\\nThe third hypothesis predicts that CEO duality is negatively associated with the firm financial \\\\nperformance. The positively signed coefficient and the significant relationship showed in the results \\\\nreject this study‟s argument a nd hypothesis with regard to ROE, ROA and Tobin‟s Q. The fourth  \\\\nhypothesis reflects that as board meetings frequency increase, the firm financial performance will \\\\nincrease, this hypothesis is supported with regard to ROE but not supported for the ROA and T obin‟s \\\\nQ. The fifth hypothesis predicts that the relationship between the director ownership and the \\\\ncompany financial performance is positive. The study results showed that there is a positive but not \\\\nsignificant relationship between ROE and ROA and the d irectors‟ ownership. Also the relationship \\\\nbetween the director ownership and Tobin‟s Q  is negative but not significant; t herefore , this \\\\nhypothesis is rejected . \\\\n \\\\nThe firm size as a control variable  has a positive significant relationship with ROE  and ROA , this \\\\nresult supports claims in prior studies that higher firm performance is associated with larger sized \\\\nfirms , but the relation is negative with the Tobin‟s Q . While, Firm age showed an insignificant \\\\nnegative relationship  with ROE and ROA but the relatio n is significant with the Tobin‟s Q.  The firm \\\\nleverage  showed a positive but not significant relationship with ROE , negative and significant \\\\nrelationship with ROA, and positive significant with Tobin‟s Q.  \\\\n \\\\nAcknowledgment  \\\\n \\\\nThis research paper is based upon  a PhD thesis that will be submitted by Mrwan Amer  to Cardiff \\\\nMetropolitan University.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\nProceedings of 6th Annual American Business Research Conference  \\\\n9 - 10 June 2014, Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel, New York, USA,  ISBN:  978-1-922069 -52-8  \\\\n \\\\n20 \\\\n References  \\\\n \\\\n- Abdullah, S.

These policies have been consistently followed for all presented periods, except for re -\\\\nmeasurement of financial assets and recognition of profits and losses arising during the comparative \\\\nperiod.  \\\\n(A) Investment in subsidiaries and associates  \\\\nA/1 Subsidiaries  \\\\nSubsidiaries are entities that ADIB has the ability to directly or indirectly control its financial and \\\\noperating policies, and ADIB usually has ownership share that exceeds one -half of the voting rights. \\\\nThis takes into consideration the impact of the fut ure voting rights, which  can be exercised or converted \\\\nat the current time when evaluating ADIB’s ability to control the subsidiaries . \\\\n \\\\nA/2 Associates  \\\\nAssociates are all entities in which ADIB has directly or indirectly significant influence, which does not \\\\nreach the limit of control, and ADIB usually owns between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.  \\\\nThe purchasing method is used by ADIB to account for the acquisition of companies. Acquisition cost \\\\nis measured at fair value or the consideration provided by A DIB for the assets of purchase and/or issued \\\\nequity instruments and/or liabilities incurred by ADIB and/or liabilities assumed by ADIB on behalf of \\\\nacquire , at the date of exchange plus any costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Net assets including \\\\nidentifiable contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. Irrespective to \\\\nthe existence of non -controlling Profit s, the excess in acquisition cost over ADIBs’ share of the fair \\\\nvalue in the net assets acquired is considered as goodwill. If the acquisition cost is less than the fair value \\\\nof the net assets, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of incom e within the item \\\"Other \\\\noperating income / (expenses)”.  \\\\nAssociates and subsidiaries at ADIB’s separate financial statements are accounted for using the cost \\\\nmethod. According to this method, investments are recognized  at the cost of acquisition, including  \\\\ngoodwill, less any impairment loss. Dividends are recognized  in the statement of income, when the \\\\ndividends are approved to be distributed and ADIB\\\\'s right of collection is established.  \\\\n \\\\n(B) Operating Sectors  \\\\nThe operating sectors participating in ADIB\\\\'s business activities are reported in line with the internal \\\\nreports submitted to ADIB\\\\'s department Chief Operating Decision Maker, considering that the \\\\nmanagement represented in the Board of Directors, the Executive Management and the relevant \\\\ncommittees / or its designee at the foreign branches is responsible for making operational decisions  about \\\\nthe resources to be allocated to the operating sectors and assessing their performance.\\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n13 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies – continued  \\\\n \\\\n (C) Sectors reporting  \\\\nAn activity sector is a group of assets and processes associated with the provision of products or services \\\\nthat are characterized by risks and benefits and differ from those of other sectors of activity. The \\\\ngeographical sector is engaged in the provision of products or services within a single economic \\\\nenvironment with risks and benefits t hat are related to geographical sectors operating in a different \\\\neconomic environment.  \\\\nADIB is divided into two main sectors: Corporate Banking Services and Retail Banking for Individuals. \\\\nIn addition, the Corporate Centre is a central funding department f or ADIB\\\\'s core business. For the \\\\ndealings of the department of transactions, investment activity and other non -core activities, they are \\\\nreported within the Corporate Banking Services  \\\\nFor the purpose of sectors reporting in accordance with the classificati on of geographic regions, the \\\\nSector\\\\'s profits, loss es, assets and liabilities are presented on a basis of branches’ locations.  \\\\nBased on the fact that ADIB (ADIB - Egypt) does not have an entity to register abroad, the sectors report  \\\\npresent, unless otherw ise stated in a certain disclosure, all ADIB\\\\'s investments in equity instruments and \\\\ndebt instruments issued by foreign institutions, as well as, credit facilities granted by ADIB to foreign \\\\nparties based on the location of the local branch in which such a ssets are registered.  \\\\n \\\\n(D) Foreign currency translation  \\\\nD/1 Functional and presentation currency  \\\\nThe financial statements of ADIB are presented using the currency of the primary economic environment \\\\nin which ADIB exercises its business (the functional currency). ADIB\\\\'s financial statements are \\\\npresented in Egyptian pounds, which is ADIB\\\\'s functi onal and presentation currency.  \\\\nD/2 Transactions and balances in foreign currencies  \\\\nADIB keeps its accounting records in Egyptian pound. Foreign currency transac tions during the financial \\\\nperiod / year are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. All monetary \\\\nassets and liabilities balances in foreign currencies at the end of the financial year are re -translated based \\\\non the e xchange rates prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settlement \\\\nof such transactions and translation differences are recognized  in the statement of profit and loss under \\\\nthe following items:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Net trading income or net income from financial instruments classified at fair value through profit \\\\nor loss for trading assets / liabilities or those classified at fair value through profit or loss based on \\\\nclassification of the asset or liability.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Within other comprehensive income  items of equity with regard to Islamic futures exchange \\\\ncontracts / Islamic currency swap contracts as qualifying hedge (eligible) for cash flows or as \\\\nqualifying hedge for net investment.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Within other comprehensive income items of equity for financial in vestments of equity instruments \\\\nat fair value through other comprehensive income.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Other operating income (expenses) for the remaining items.\\\\n--- Page 14 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n14 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\nChanges in the fair value of monetary financial  instruments in foreign currency classified as investments \\\\nat fair value are analyzed  within the other comprehensive income through differences from changes in \\\\namortized  costs of the instrument, differences from changes in the prevailing exchange rates, an d \\\\ndifferences from changes in the fair value of the instrument. Differences related to changes in the \\\\namortized  cost are recognized  into statement of profit and loss under funds and similar revenues, and \\\\nthose related to the changes in the exchange rates u nder other operating income (expenses). Differences \\\\nfrom changes in the fair value (fair value reserve/ financial investments at fair value through other \\\\ncomprehensive income) are recognized  within equity of comprehensive income items.  \\\\nValuation difference s result from non -cash items include profit and loss from change in fair value such \\\\nas equity instruments at fair value through profit and loss. Valuation differences result from equity \\\\ninstruments classified as financial investments at fair value through comprehensive income statement \\\\nare recognized  in statement  of other comprehensive income.  \\\\nE) Financial assets and financial liabilities  \\\\nE/1. Initial recognition and measurement  \\\\nADIB conducts initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities on the date on which ADIB becomes \\\\na party to the contractual conditions of financial instrument.  \\\\nThe financial asset or liability is initially measured at fair value. With regard to ass et or liability that is \\\\nnot subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss, it would be measured at fair value plus \\\\ncost of transaction that is connected directl y with acquisition or issuance.  \\\\nE/2. Classification  \\\\nFinancial assets - Applicable Policy as of January 1, 2019  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Upon initial recognition, ADIB classifies the financial assets into financial assets at amortized  cost, \\\\nfinancial assets at fair value through statement of other comprehensive income or at fair value \\\\nthrough profit and loss.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial asset is measured at amortized  cost upon fulfilment of the following two conditions \\\\nand when it has not been allocated by Bank’s management upon initial recognition at fair value \\\\nthrough profit and loss:  \\\\n- The financial asset is held within a bus iness model whose purpose is to hold financial asset to \\\\ncollect contractual cash flows.  \\\\n- The contractual conditions of financial asset result, on specific dates, in contractual cash flows \\\\nfor the asset and is represented only in the principal amount of the financial instrument and the \\\\nProfit .  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income upon fulfilment \\\\nof the following two conditions and when it has not been allocated upon initial recognition at fair \\\\nvalue through profit and loss:  \\\\n- The financial asset is held within a business model whose purpose is to collect contractual cash \\\\nflows and sell the financial asset.  \\\\n- The contractual conditions of financial asset result, on specific dates, in contractual cash flows \\\\nfor the asset and is not represent only in the principal debt and the Profit . \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Upon initial recognition of an equity instrument not held for trading, ADIB can take irrevocable \\\\noption to present subsequent changes in fair value through statement of other comprehensive inc ome. \\\\nSuch option is adopted for each investment individually.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 15 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n15 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies -

Such information, which is \\\\ntaken into consi deration when evaluating the business model, includes the following:  \\\\n- Documented approved policies and portfolio’s objectives and application of such policies in the real \\\\nworld. In particular, whether the management’s strategy focuses only upon collection o f contractual \\\\ncash flows and holding a definite Profit  rate to compare maturity dates of financial assets with \\\\nmaturity dates of liabilities that fund such assets or generates cash flows from sale of assets.  \\\\n- Way of evaluating and reporting on portfolio’s performance to senior management.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 17 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n17 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\n- Risks that affect business model performance including nature of financial assets held in such model \\\\nand the way of managing such risks.  \\\\n- Way of evaluating the performance of busi ness managers (fair value and/or Profit  on portfolio).  \\\\n- Periodic, value and date of sale transactions in previous periods, reasons of such transactions, and \\\\nforecasts regarding future sale activities. However, information regarding sale activities is not t aken \\\\ninto consideration separately but as a part of a whole comprehensive valuation of how to achieve \\\\nADIB’s objective from managing the financial assets and how to generate cash flows.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial assets held for trading, or managed and its performance  valued on basis of fair value \\\\nare measured at fair value through profit and loss since they are not held to collect contractual cash \\\\nflows or to collect contractual cash flows and sell financial assets together.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Valuation of whether the contractual cash flows of an asset represent payments restricted \\\\nupon principal amount of instrument and Profit    \\\\n-  For purpose of this valuation, ADIB identifies the principal amount of financial instrument as the \\\\nfair value of financial asset upon initial recognition. Fur ther, ADIB identifies the Profit  as time value \\\\nfor money and credit risks related to the principal amount during specific period and other main \\\\nfinance risks and costs (such as liquidity risks and administrative costs) in addition to profit margin.  \\\\n- In order to evaluate whether the contractual cash flows of the asset are represented in payments \\\\nrestricted upon the principal of financial instrument and Profit , ADIB takes into its consideration \\\\nthe contractual conditions of the instrument. This includes  valuation of whether the financial asset \\\\nincludes contractual conditions that may change date or amount of contractual cash flows which \\\\nresult in breach of this condition. In order to carry out such valuation, ADIB takes into consideration \\\\nthe following m atters:  \\\\n- Potential events that may change the amount or date of cash flows.  \\\\n- Specifications of financial leverage ( Profit  rate, terms, currency type ...).  \\\\n- Terms of accelerated payment and term extension.  \\\\n- Terms that may limit ADIB’s ability to claim cash flows from certain assets.  \\\\n- Specifications that may be amended for time value of cash (periodically repricing Profit  rate).  \\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n18 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\nFinancial liabilities  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Upon initial recognition, ADIB classifies financial liabilities into financial liabilities at amortised \\\\ncost and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss according to purpose of bank’s \\\\nbusiness model.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 All financial liabilities at fair value are initially recognised on the date when ADIB becomes party \\\\nto contractual conditions of financial instrument.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Classified financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost based on amortised cost \\\\nby using effective Profit  rate. \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities at fair value through prof it and loss are subsequently measured at fair value \\\\nand change in fair value related to change in credit rating degree of ADIB is recognised in \\\\nstatement of other comprehensive income whilst the outstanding amount from change in fair value \\\\nis presented in profit and loss.  \\\\nReclassification  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial assets are reclassified upon initial recognition only if ADIB changes business model \\\\nof managing such assets.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 In all cases, reclassification between financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss  and \\\\nfinancial liabilities at amortised cost are not conducted.  \\\\nC/3. Exclusion  \\\\n1- Financial assets  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The financial asset is excluded when the effective period of contractual right to obtain cash flows from \\\\nfinancial asset expires or ADIB transfers the right to receive contractual cash flows in a transaction whereby \\\\nthe risks and benefits associated materially with ownership are transferred to another party.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When a financial asset is excluded, difference between asset’s book value (or book value allocated to part  \\\\nof the excluded principal) and total of received consideration (including any new asset obtained less any \\\\nnew commitment incurred) and any consolidated profit and loss has been previously recognised in the fair \\\\nvalue reserve of financial investments at fa ir value through statement of other comprehensive income is \\\\nrecognised in statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 As of 1 January 2019, any accumulated profit or loss recognised in statement of other comprehensive \\\\nincome related to investing in equity instruments a llocated as investments at fair value through statement \\\\nof other comprehensive income are not recognised in profit and loss upon disposal of such asset. Any share \\\\nresulted or held from the asset qualified for disposal (eligible for disposal) is recognised as separate asset \\\\nor liability.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When ADIB makes transactions whereby it transfers assets that have been previously recognised in \\\\nstatement of financial position, but materially held most of risks and benefits associated with the transferred \\\\nasset or part o f it. In such cases, the transferred asset is not excluded.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 In respect of transactions in which ADIB does not materially hold or transfer all risks and benefits \\\\nassociated with asset ownership and hold control over the asset, ADIB continues to recognise t he asset \\\\nwithin the limitation of its continuous commitment to financial asset. The continuous commitment of ADIB \\\\nto the financial asset is determined based on ADIB’s exposure to the changes in the value of transferred \\\\nasset.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 In some transactions, ADIB holds the commitment to provide transferred asset in return for commission. \\\\nThereupon, the transferred asset is excluded if it meets the exclusion conditions. An asset or liability to \\\\nprovide service is recognised if the service commission is higher than t he appropriate amount (asset) or less \\\\nthan the appropriate amount (liability) to perform the service.  \\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n19 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\n2- Financial liabilities  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB excludes financial liabilities when the financial liability is disposed of or cancelled or its term \\\\nset forth in the contract expires.  \\\\nC/4. Adjustments to financial assets and financial liabilities  \\\\n1- Financial assets  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7  If the terms of a financial asset are amended, ADIB evaluates whether the cash flows of adjusted \\\\nasset are materially different. If the cash flows materially differ, the contractual rights of cash flows \\\\nfrom the original financial asset are considered exp ired and hence the original financial asset is \\\\nexcluded and the new financial asset is recognised at fair value and the value resulting from \\\\nadjusting aggregate book value is recognised as profits or losses under profits and losses. On the \\\\nother hand, if s uch adjustment has occurred due to financial difficulties of the borrower, the profits \\\\nhave to be deferred and presented with aggregate impairment losses whilst losses have to be \\\\nrecognised in the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 If the cash flows of adjusted  asset recognised at amortised cost do not materially differ, the \\\\nadjustment will not result in the exclusion of the financial asset.  \\\\n2- Financial liabilities  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB may adjust a financial liability when its terms are amended and the cash flows of adjusted \\\\nliability will materially differ. In such case, a new financial asset is recognised according to the \\\\namended terms at fair value. The difference between book value of old financial liability and new \\\\nfinancial liability is recognised in accordance with amended terms in the profit and loss.  \\\\n \\\\nH) Offsetting financial assets and liabilities  \\\\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the \\\\nrecognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the \\\\nliability simultaneously.  \\\\n \\\\nAn offset is made only between revenues and expenses, if permitted in accordance with the amended \\\\nEgyptian Accounting Standards, or profit or loss result from similar groups because of trading \\\\nactivity or the result of translation differences of the balances of assets and liabilities of monetary \\\\nnature into foreign currency or the result of profits (losses) from foreign currency operations.  \\\\n \\\\nI) Measurement of fair value  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB sets the fair value on bas is that it is the price that will be obtained for the sale of an asset or \\\\nwill be paid for transfer of a liability in a transaction made between the participants in the market \\\\non measurement date taking specifications of the asset or liability into conside ration when \\\\nmeasuring the fair value if the participants in the market took such specifications into consideration \\\\nwhen pricing the asset and/or liability on measurement date as such specifications include status \\\\nand position of the asset and restrictions upon sale or use of the asset as per the perspective of \\\\nparticipants in the market.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 20 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n20 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB uses market methodology to determine fair value of financial assets and liabilities as such \\\\nmethodology uses other relevant prices and information result from market transactions that include \\\\nassets or liabilities or set of assets and liabilities and are typical or comparable. Accordingly, ADIB \\\\nuses valuation methods that are in consistent with m arket methodology such as market multiples \\\\nderived from comparable sets. Thereupon, it is required to opt for the appropriate multiplier within \\\\nrange using personal judgement taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors \\\\nof the measur ement.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When it cannot  be relied upon the market approach to determine the fair value of a financial asset \\\\nor financial liability, ADIB uses the income approach to determine fair value whereby future \\\\npayments such as cash flow or income and expenses are tr ansferred to current amount (discounted) \\\\nso that the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about future payments.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 When it cannot  be relied upon market approach or income approach to determine the fair value of a \\\\nfinancial asset or fi nancial liability, ADIB uses the cost method to determine fair value in order to \\\\nreflect the amount currently claimed to replace the asset in its current state (the current replacement \\\\ncost) so that the fair value reflects the cost incurred by the particip ant in the market as a buyer of \\\\nacquiring an alternative asset of similar benefits since the participant in the market as a buyer will \\\\nnot pay for an asset more than the amount that replaces benefit of the asset.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The measurement method of financial assets and liabilities at fair value are set below in the financial \\\\nstatements within the hierarchy of the fair value, based on the input levels that are considered to be \\\\nsignificant to the fair value measurement as a whole  \\\\n \\\\n- Level 1 - Inputs of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, \\\\nwhich ADIB can have access to at the date of measurement.  \\\\n- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or \\\\nliability, either directl y or indirectly.  \\\\n- Level 3 - Unobservable inputs of the asset or the liability.  \\\\nThe following table shows the change in the measurement methods of the fair value of financial assets \\\\nat 31 December 2023, compared to the comparative figures at 31 December 2022 \\\\n \\\\n (E/1) Financial instruments at level 1  \\\\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted prices at the date of \\\\nstatement of financial statements. The market is deemed active when the items in the market are similar \\\\nand there are usual buyers and sellers willing to deal at any time normally.  ADIB has used the declared \\\\nquoted price to determine the fair value of this level. The instruments included in Level 1 comprise \\\\ninvestments held for trading in the st ock exchanges.  \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n21 \\\\n (E/2) Financial instruments at level 2  \\\\nThe fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using \\\\nvaluation techniques. These valuation techniques depend  on the use of observable inputs of the asset \\\\nor the liability directly or indirectly. The fair value method is included in the second level if all \\\\nsignificant inputs are observable throughout the period of the financial asset or liability. If an important  \\\\ninput is not observable, the financial instrument will be included in the third level.  \\\\nSpecific valuation techniques used to determine fair values of financial instruments include:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Profit  rate swaps by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on \\\\nobservable Profit  curves.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using the current value of the \\\\nexpected cash flows by using the future for eign exchange of the currency of contract.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Analysis of deducted cash flows to determine fair values of other financial instruments.  \\\\n \\\\nJ) Profit  income and expenses  \\\\n- Profit  income and expense for all Profit -bearing financial instruments, except for those classified as \\\\nheld for trading or designated initially at fair value through profit and loss, are recognised in the \\\\nstatement of profit and loss within ‘ Profit  of similar funds and revenues\\\\' using the effective Profit  \\\\nmethod.  \\\\n \\\\n- According to the effective Profit rate method, the amortised cost of an asset or financial liability is \\\\ncalculated and allocation of income revenues or expenses Profit  is distributed throughout the life of \\\\nrelated instrument. The effective Profit  rate represents the rate used to disco unt future cash flows \\\\nexpected to be paid or collected during the expected life of the financial instrument, or less time if \\\\nappropriate in order to accurately determine the book value of an asset or financial liability. When \\\\ncalculating the effective Profit rate, ADIB estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of \\\\nthe financial instrument (for example, early payment options) but does not consider future credit \\\\nlosses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the cont ract that are \\\\nconsidered as part of the effective Profit  rate. Also, the transaction cost includes any premiums or \\\\ndiscounts.  \\\\n \\\\n- When funds or receivables are classified as impaired funds and debts, the related Profit  income is \\\\nnot recognised but is rather c arried off the financial statements in marginal records and is recognised \\\\nunder revenues according to cash basis as per the following:  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 When they are collected, after receiving all past due instalments for consumption and real estate \\\\nfunds for personal housing and small funds for economic activities.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 For corporate funds, cash basis is also applied, where the Profit  subsequently calculated is given in \\\\naccordance with the fund scheduling contract, until 25% of the scheduling instalments are repaid \\\\nand with  a minimum of one year of regular repayment. In case the customer continues to make \\\\npayments on a regular basis, the Profit  calculated on the fund outstanding is recognised in revenues \\\\n(Profit  on regular scheduling balance) without marginal Profit  before s cheduling which is not \\\\nrecognised as revenues except after paying all the fund balance in the balance sheet before \\\\nscheduling.  \\\\n--- Page 22 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n22 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies – continued  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nK) Fees and commission income  \\\\n \\\\n- Fees that are due for a banking process or fund service or a facility are recognised as revenues \\\\nwhen the service is rendered. The recognition of the fees and commissions income related to \\\\nimpaired funds or debts is suspended and they are carried in margin al records off the balance sheet \\\\nand are recognised under revenues according to the cash basis when Profit  income is recognised \\\\nin accordance with item (2 -I). Fees that generally represent a complementing part of the financial \\\\nasset effective rate are reco gnised as adjustment to the effective Profit  rate. \\\\n \\\\n- Commitment fees on funds are deferred when there is probability that funds will be used, as the \\\\ncommitment fees received by ADIB represent compensation for the continuous interference to \\\\nacquire the finan cial instrument. Subsequently, it is recognised as adjustment to the effective Profit  \\\\nrate on funds. If the commitment period passes without issuing the fund, the commitment fees are \\\\nrecognised as income at the end of the commitment period. If there is no probability that these \\\\nfunds are used, the commitment fees are recognized on the basis of the relative time distribution \\\\nover the period of the commitment . \\\\n \\\\n- Fees related to debt instruments measured at its fair value are recognised as income at initial \\\\nrecognition. Fees related to marketing of syndicated funds are recognised as income when the \\\\nmarketing process is completed and the fund is fully used or if ADI B kept its share of the \\\\nsyndicated funds using the effective Profit  rate as used by the other participants.  \\\\n \\\\n- Fees and commissions arising from negotiation or participating in negotiation over a transaction \\\\nin favour of another party -such as arrangement to  buy shares or other financial instruments or \\\\nacquire or sell entities, are recognised in statement of profit and loss upon the completion of the \\\\nconcerned transaction. Fees of management consultation and other services are usually recognised \\\\non a time -apportion basis over the period of performing the service. Financial planning and \\\\ncustody services fees provided on long periods are recognised over the period in which the service \\\\nis provided.  \\\\n \\\\nL) Dividends income  \\\\n- Dividends on ADIB\\\\'s investments in equity instruments and its equivalents are recognised in the \\\\nstatement of profit and loss when the right to collect them is established.   \\\\n \\\\nM) Purchase and resale agreements & sale and repurchase agreements  \\\\n- Sold financial in struments under repurchase agreements are presented within assets in the \\\\ntreasury bills and other government securities line item in the financial position.

This evaluation is mad e periodically at the level of the \\\\ncounterparty. Criteria used are periodically reviewed and monitored to determine the significant \\\\nincrease in credit risk by the credit risk department.  \\\\n- At the date of the financial statements, ADIB estimates the impairmen t loss for financial \\\\ninstruments at a value equal to the expected credit losses over the life of the financial instrument \\\\nexcept for the following cases where the provision for impairment losses is estimated at a value \\\\nequal to the expected credit losses o ver the (12) twelve months:  \\\\n- A debt instrument that has been identified as having low credit risk at the financial statements date \\\\n(debt instruments in the stage (1)).  \\\\n- Other financial instruments whose credit risk at the reporting date has not increased sig nificantly \\\\nsince the initial recognition (debt instruments in the stage (1)).  \\\\n- ADIB considers the expected credit losses to be a probability -weighted estimate of the expected \\\\ncredit losses, which are measured as follows:  \\\\n- The expected credit losses on financ ial assets are measured at the stage (1) based on the present \\\\nvalue of the total cash deficit calculated on the basis of the historical probability of default \\\\nscenarios, which are adjusted according to the average forecasts of the scenarios of \\\\nmacroeconomi c indicators for the future (12) twelve months multiplied by the value at default, \\\\ntaking into account the expected recovery rates upon calculating the loss rate for each group of \\\\ndebt instruments with similar credit risk. As expected credit losses take in to account the amount \\\\nand timing of payments, the credit losses arise even if the enterprise expects full repayment but \\\\nlater on after the debt becomes payable under contractual terms. The expected credit losses over \\\\n(12) twelve -month period will be deemed  a part of the expected credit losses over the life of the \\\\nasset which result from defaults on a financial instrument within (12) twelve months after the date \\\\nof the financial statements.  \\\\n- The expected credit losses on financial assets are measured at the s tage (2) based on the present \\\\nvalue of the total cash deficit calculated on the basis of the historical probability of default \\\\nscenarios and adjusted by the average forecasts of macroeconomic indicators for the life of the \\\\nfinancial asset multiplied by the  value at default, taking into account the expected recovery rates \\\\nupon calculating the loss rate for each group of debt instruments with similar credit risk.  \\\\n- Impaired financial assets at the financial statements date are measured as the difference between  \\\\nthe total book value of the asset and the present value of the expected future cash flows.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Commitments on funds and similar debt instruments are included in the calculation of value upon \\\\ndefault. They are calculated on the balances outstanding on the date of the financial statements \\\\nafter they have been converted into value in the event that these commitments are used in the \\\\nfuture.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Upon calculating loss rates, ADIB calculates the expected recovery rates from the present value \\\\nof the expected cash flo ws either from cash and in kind collateral; or historical or expected future \\\\npayment rates as follows:  \\\\n- For debt instruments classified in stage (1), it is taken into account the value of cash collateral and \\\\nequivalents represented in cash and other financ ial instruments that may be easily converted into \\\\ncash within a short period of time (3 months or less) and without any change (loss) in value as a \\\\nresult of credit risk after deducting 10% for the unexpected circumstances.  \\\\n- For the debt instruments classif ied in the stages (2) and (3), only the types of guarantees will be \\\\nconsidered in accordance with the rules issued by the (CBE) dated 24/5/2005 regarding the \\\\ndetermination of the creditworthiness of the customers and formation of the provisions, while the \\\\nvalue of such guarantees will be calculated according to the rules of preparing and presenting the \\\\nfinancial statements of the banks, the recognition and measurement bases issued by the (CBE) \\\\ndated 16 December 2008, after deducting 10% and 20% of the cash collateral and the present value \\\\nof the future cash flows of the in -kind collateral, respectively.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 27 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n27 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies - continued  \\\\nMeasurement of expected credit losses - continued  \\\\n- For debt instruments held by banks operating outside Egypt,  the probability rates of default are \\\\ndetermined on the basis of the credit rating of the headquarters of ADIB operating outside of Egypt \\\\nin no more than the credit rating of the country of the headquarters, taking into consideration the \\\\ninstructions issue d by the Central Bank of Egypt on the risks of countries.

The \\\\nexpected credit losses are calculated over the life of the instrument.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7  If restructuring results in exclusion of the current asset, the expect ed fair value of the new asset \\\\nwill be deemed as final cash flows from the current financial asset upon exclusion. This value will \\\\nbe used to calculate the cash deficit from the current financial asset, which is deducted from the \\\\nexpected date of the asset  exclusion at the financial statements date using the original effective \\\\nProfit  rate of the current financial asset.  \\\\n \\\\nPresentation of the expected credit losses provisions in the statement of financial position  \\\\n- The provision for expected credit losses is p resented in the statement of financial position as \\\\nfollows:  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Financial assets measured at amortized cost as a deduction from the total book value of the assets.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Financial commitments and financial guarantee contracts as a provision in general.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 When the financial instrument includes both the used and unused permissible limit of the \\\\ninstrument and ADIB cannot determine the expected credit losses of the unused portion separately, \\\\nADIB presents a provision for the loss of the used and unused portion , and the aggregate amount \\\\nwill be presented as a deduction from the total book value for the used portion. Any increase in \\\\nthe loss provision is presented on the total amount of the used portion as a provision of the unused \\\\nportion.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 A provision for impairment of debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income \\\\nis not recognized in the statement of financial position because the book value of such assets is \\\\ntheir fair value.

Direct c osts also include the cost of the staff involved in upgrading the \\\\nsoftware in addition to a reasonable portion of relative overheads.  \\\\n- The expenses which lead to the increase or expansion in the performance of computer software \\\\nbeyond their original specifi cations are recognised as a development cost and are added to the \\\\noriginal software cost, when all the following conditions are fulfilled:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 ADIB has the intention and the ability to c omplete and use that  software.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Development -related expenditures can be reliably measured.  \\\\n- The computer software cost recognised as an asset is amortised over the expected useful life as \\\\nfollows:  \\\\n \\\\nAsset type  Default Life / deprecation rate  \\\\nComputer Software  3 years  \\\\n \\\\nO/ 2 Other intangible assets  \\\\n- Other intangible assets comprise all intangible assets other than goodwill and computer software.  \\\\n- Other intangible assets are recognised at cost of acquisition and amortised on a straight -line basis \\\\nor on the basis of expected economic benefits over the estimated useful lives. As sets that do not \\\\nhave a definite useful life are not amortised, but impairment is tested annually and the impairment \\\\nvalue (if any) is charged to the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n \\\\nP) Fixed assets  \\\\n- Lands and buildings are primarily represented in head offices,  branches and offices. All assets are \\\\npresented at historical cost less depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes \\\\nexpenses associated directly with acquiring fixed assets items.  \\\\n- Subsequent costs are recognised in the asset’s carrying amo unt or are recognised as a separate \\\\nasset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the \\\\nasset will flow to the Bank and the cost can be measured reliably. Main tenance and repair expenses \\\\nare charged to other op erating expenses during the period / year in which they are incurred.  \\\\n- Lands are not depreciated.

Depreciable Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events \\\\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recovered. An asset’s \\\\ncarrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable value if the asset’s carrying \\\\namount exceeds it s estimated recoverable amount.  \\\\n- The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s net selling amount and value in use. Profits \\\\nand losses on disposals from fixed assets are determined by comparing net proceeds with carrying \\\\namount. Profits/ (losses) are included in other operating income (expenses) in the statement of \\\\nprofit and loss.  \\\\n \\\\nQ) Impairment of non -financial assets  \\\\n- Assets that do not have definite life time are not depreciated and their impairment is reviewed \\\\nannually.  Impairment of depreciated assets is examined when there are events or changes in \\\\ncircumstances that indicate that the book value may be partially or wholly non -recoverable.  \\\\n \\\\n- Impairment loss is recognised and the asset value is deducted at the amount by which the asset’s \\\\nbook value increases over the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount represents the higher \\\\nof the asset’s net selling amount and value in use. For the purpose of estimating impairment, the \\\\nasset is grouped to the smallest possible cash generating unit. The non -financial assets are \\\\nreviewed for any impairment in order to determine if impairment can be reversed to the statement \\\\nof pro fit and loss at the date of each financial statement.  \\\\n \\\\nR)  Leases  \\\\n- Finance leases are accounted for in accordance with Law 95 of 1995 concerning Finance Lease if \\\\nthe contract grants the right to the lessee to purchase the asset on a specified date and at a specified \\\\nvalue; and the contract period represents at least 75 % of the expected useful life of the asset, or \\\\nthe present value of the total lease payments represents at least 90% of the value of the asset. Other \\\\nleases are considered operating leases.  \\\\n \\\\nR/1 Leasing  \\\\n- Finance lease contracts, lease costs including maintenance expense of leased assets are recognised \\\\nunder expenses in the statement of profit and loss in the year / period incurred. If the Bank decides \\\\nto exercise the right to purchase the leased  assets, the cost of this right of purchase is capitalised \\\\nas an asset within the fixed asset and depreciated over the assets\\\\' expected remaining useful life in \\\\nthe same way used with similar assets.  \\\\n- Payments made under operating leases, less any discounts  received from the lessor, are recognised \\\\nas expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight -line basis over the period of the lease.  \\\\n \\\\nS) Cash and cash equivalents  \\\\n- For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include balances due \\\\nwithin three months from the date of acquisition, which includes cash and balances with central \\\\nbanks other than the statutory reserve, and balances with banks and other government notes.  \\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n31 \\\\n Summary of accounting policie s - continued  \\\\nT) Other provisions  \\\\n- Other provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result \\\\nof past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; \\\\nand the amount has been reliably estimated.  \\\\n- Where there are a number of similar obligations, the outflow required for settlement is determined, \\\\ntaking into consideration the group of obligations as a whole. The provision is recognised even if \\\\nthe likelihood of an outflow wit h respect to an item in the group is minimal.  \\\\n- Provisions no longer required fully or partially are reversed in other operating income (expenses).  \\\\n- The current value of payments to settle the obligations that must be settled after one year from the \\\\nfinancial  position date using an appropriate rate in accordance with the terms of settlement, without \\\\nbeing affected by the prevailing tax rate, which reflects the time value of money. If the settlement \\\\nterm is less than one year, the estimated value of the obligat ion is calculated unless it has a material \\\\nimpact; otherwise, it is calculated at the current value.  \\\\n \\\\nU) Commitments of financing and financial guarantee contracts  \\\\n- Financial guarantees represent contracts in which ADIB is the guarantor or the guarantor of \\\\nfinancing or overdrafts (mudaraba) towards other entities. This requires ADIB to make certain \\\\npayments to compensate the beneficiary for loss incurred due to defaul t of the debtor when \\\\npayment is due in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument. These financial guarantees \\\\nare given to banks, financial institutions and other entities on behalf of ADIB\\\\'s customers.  \\\\n- Commitments on financing are the commitments u nder which the Bank grants credit according to \\\\npre-determined terms and thus guarantees include the unused portions of the credit limits granted \\\\nwithin the amounts expected to be used by ADIB in the future. The financial guarantee contracts \\\\nand commitments  of granting finance at Profit  rates below the market price are initially recognized \\\\nin the financial statements at fair value on the date of granting the guarantee / commitment. The \\\\ninitially recognized fair value is amortized over the life of the guarant ee / commitment.  \\\\n- In subsequent measurement, ADIB\\\\'s obligation under the guarantee / commitment is measured as \\\\nfollows:  \\\\nThe higher of the amortized value or the impairment loss value.  \\\\n- ADIB has not made any commitments during the period / year on finances m easured at fair value \\\\nthrough profit and loss.  \\\\n- For other commitments on finances:  ADIB recognizes impairment losses.  \\\\n- Liabilities arising from financial guarantee contracts are recognized within provisions. Any excess \\\\nof the liability arising from the fina ncial guarantee is recognized in the statement of profit and loss \\\\nwithin other operating revenues (expenses) in the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\n- The calculated provision for commitments for financing is recognized as part of the provision for \\\\nimpairment of financing for each debt, to the extent that it equals the value of financing. Any \\\\nincrease in the provision for commitment over finance is recognized within provisions in the \\\\nstatement of financial position.  \\\\n--- Page 32 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n32 \\\\n Summary of accounti ng policies - continued  \\\\nV) Obligations of retirement benefits  \\\\n V/1 Employees\\\\' fund  \\\\n- On the 1st of July 2013, ADIB established a special social insurance fund (the Fund) under Law \\\\nNo. 54 of 1975, \\\"Special Insurance Funds and its Executive Regulations”. ADIB registered the \\\\nFund on 14 January 2014 and the Fund\\\\'s registration number with the Financial Supervisory \\\\nAuthority is (884). The Fund\\\\'s work began on the 1st of April 2014 and the terms o f this Fund and \\\\nits amendments apply on all employees of the headquar ters of ADIB and its branches in the Arab \\\\nRepublic of Egypt.  \\\\n- ADIB is obliged to pay to the Fund the contributions due for each month calculated in accordance \\\\nwith the regulations of the Fund and its amendments , however, there is no obligation on ADIB \\\\nEgypt  if the Fund  is insufficient. The  Fund is financed in general through monthly contributions \\\\nand some other resources set forth in the regulations of the Fund.  \\\\n- Payment of insurance benefits is made in the case of termination of service due to the member\\\\'s \\\\nretirement age, death, whole permanent disability or partial permanent disability from the service. \\\\nIn the event that the term of the membership is less than three years, the member of the Fund is \\\\npaid the final balance of his account corresponding to the c ontributions paid by him to the Fund \\\\non the date of termination of service or membership.  \\\\n V/2 System of defined benefits for the medical care of senior employees during  the period of \\\\nservice and after retirement  \\\\n- ADIB applies the system of medical contribution specified for the senior employees during the \\\\nservice and after retirement. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined \\\\nbenefit plans comprises the present value of the defined benefit liabilities at the balance she et date \\\\nafter deduction of the fair value of the assets of the plan and the deduction (addition) of the \\\\nunrealised actuarial profit (loss) adjustments and the cost of the additional benefits relating to the \\\\nprevious service periods.  \\\\n- The liability of the de fined benefit plans (future cash flows expected to be paid) is calculated by \\\\nan independent actuarial expert using the projected unit credit method.  The present value of the \\\\nobligation of the defined benefit plans is determined by discounting the expected  future cash flows \\\\nusing the Profit  rate of high quality corporate notes or the Profit  rate on government notes bonds \\\\nin the same currency of paying the benefits and with almost the same maturity term of the pension \\\\nbenefit liability.  \\\\n- Gains (losses) arisin g from adjustments and changes in estimates and actuarial assumptions are \\\\ncalculated and the gains are deducted (and losses added) to the statement of income if they do not \\\\nexceed 10% of the asset value of the plan or 10% of the defined benefit liabilities , whichever is \\\\nhigher. In the event of an increase in gains (losses) over this ratio, the increase is deducted (added) \\\\nin the statement of income over the remaining average working years.  \\\\n- Past service costs are recognized directly in the statement of inco me within administrative \\\\nexpenses, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in \\\\nthe service for a specified period of time (Vesting period). In this case, the past servi ce costs are \\\\namortized using straight -line meth od over the vesting period.  \\\\nW) Borrowing  \\\\nADIB’s  financings are initially recognized at fair value less costs to obtain financing. The \\\\nfinancing will be subsequently measured at amortized cost. The difference between the net \\\\nproceeds and the value to be fulfilled over the period of obtaining financing u sing effective Profit  \\\\nmethod will be charged to the statement of profit and loss.  \\\\nX) Comparative figures  \\\\nWhere necessary, comparative figures are reclassified to conform to changes in presentation used \\\\nin the current period . \\\\n--- Page 33 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n33 \\\\n Summary of accounting policies – continued  \\\\nY) Income taxes  \\\\n- The income tax on profit or loss for the period/ year includes both the current and deferred taxes; \\\\nit is recognized in the statement of income except for income tax related to other comprehensive \\\\nincome items that were directly recognised in the statement  of comprehensive income.  \\\\n-  The income tax is recognised on the basis of the net taxable income using the effective tax rate \\\\nat the financial position date in addition to previous year’s  tax adjustments.  \\\\n- Deferred tax arising from temporary time differences  between the carrying amount of assets and \\\\nliabilities are recognised in accordance with the accounting bases and the value based on the tax \\\\nbases. Deferred tax is determined based on the method used to realise or settle the current values \\\\nof these assets and liabilities using the tax rates prevailing at the financial position date.  \\\\n- The deferred tax assets are recognised if it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be \\\\nrealised in the future whereby the asset can be utilised. The value of deferred  tax assets will be \\\\nreduced by the value of the portion not yielding the expected tax benefit during the following \\\\nyears. However, in case the expected tax benefit increases, the deferred tax assets will increase to \\\\nthe extent of previous reduction.   \\\\n \\\\nZ) Capital issuance fees  \\\\n-  Issued and paid up -capital (i.e. Bank\\\\'s own equity instruments) is initially measured at the \\\\ncash proceeds received, less transaction costs directly  attributable to the issuance of new \\\\nshares, issuance of shares to effect business combinat ion, or issue of share options. \\\\nTransaction costs, net of tax  benefits, are reported as a deduction from equity.  \\\\n \\\\nAA) Dividends  \\\\n- Dividends on equity instruments issued by the bank are recognized when the general \\\\nassembly of the bank’s shareholders a pproves them. Dividends include the employees’ \\\\nprofit share and the board of directors’ remuneration as prescribed by the bank\\\\'s articles of \\\\nincorporation and the corporate law.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 34 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n34 \\\\n 4-Financial risk management  \\\\n- ADIB, as a result of the activities it exercises, is exposed to various financial risks, taking into \\\\naccount that risks are the basis of the financial activity, and some risks or group of risks are \\\\nanalysed, evaluated and managed altogether. ADIB intends t o strike a balance between the risk \\\\nand return and to reduce the probable adverse effects on ADIB’s financial performance. The most \\\\nimportant types of risks are credit risk and market risk. Market risk comprises foreign currency \\\\nexchange rates, Profit  rate risk and other pricing risks.  \\\\n- The risk management policies have been laid down to determine and analyse the risks, set limits \\\\nto the risks and control them through reliable methods and up -to-date IT systems.  ADIB regularly \\\\nreviews the risk management pol icies and systems and amends them to reflect the changes in the \\\\nmarkets, products and services, and the best updated applications.  \\\\n- Risks are managed by both the Risk Committee and the Market Risk and Credit Risk Departments \\\\nin view of the policies approved  by the Board of Directors.  The Risk Departments determine, \\\\nevaluate and cover the financial risks, in collaboration with ADIB’s various operating units, and \\\\nthe Board provides written principles to manage risks as a whole, in addition to written policies  \\\\ncovering specific risk areas like credit risk, foreign exchange rate risk, Profit  rate risk and using \\\\nderivative and non -derivative financial instruments. Moreover, the Risk Committee is \\\\nindependently responsible for periodic review of risk management and  control environment.  \\\\n \\\\nRisk Management Strategy  \\\\nADIB practises its activities through business lines that generate many risks that may vary in terms \\\\nof frequency, strength and fluctuation. Therefore, ADIB has taken measures to ensure the effective \\\\nmanagement of these risks, including increasing the ability to standardize the degree of risks appetite \\\\nand risk identifiers, to develop the terms of reference of the core risk department, and to implement \\\\nan efficient and high -quality risk department stru cture.  The main objectives of ADIB\\\\'s risk \\\\ndepartment framework are as follows:  \\\\n- Contributing to the development of ADIB\\\\'s various lines of business to reach an optimum level of general \\\\nrisk. \\\\n- Ensuring the continuity of ADIB through the implementation of a h igh quality risk department \\\\ninfrastructure.  \\\\n- In determining ADIB\\\\'s overall risk appetite, ADIB\\\\'s management has taken into account various \\\\nconsiderations and variables, including:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The relative balance between risk and proceeds for ADIB\\\\'s various activities . \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The degree of the sensitivity of profits to business cycles and credit and economic cycles.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Achieving a parallel package of good profits flows   \\\\n \\\\nRisk Management Governance and Risk Management Principles  \\\\nADIB\\\\'s risk department governance is based on the following:  \\\\n \\\\n1- Strong management intervention at all levels of the organization, starting from the Board of \\\\nDirectors to the management of field task forces responsible for operations.  \\\\n2- An integrated framework for internal procedures and guidelines.  \\\\n3- Continuous  monitoring by business lines and supporting functions, as well as, by an independent \\\\nRisk Control Body and compliance with the rules and procedures.  \\\\nRisk and audit committees within the Board are more specifically responsible for examining the \\\\ncompatibili ty of the internal framework in order to monitor risks and the adherence to the rules.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 35 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n35 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n \\\\nRisk Categories:  \\\\n \\\\nThe risks associated with ADIB\\\\'s banking activities include  the following:  \\\\n4/1 Credit risk  \\\\n- Credit risk represents potential losses arising from the possibility that the borrowers or \\\\ncounterparties will fail to fulfil  their obligations in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk \\\\narises mainly from due from banks balances, financing and faci lities to banks, individuals, SMEs \\\\nand micro -enterprises, institutions and associations related to such activities. Credit risk may also \\\\narise from supporting financing / credit guarantees granted such as credit options (Credit Default \\\\nSwap), financial gua rantee contracts, letters of credit and letters of guarantee.  \\\\n- ADIB is also exposed to credit risk from investment activities in debt instruments and positions \\\\noutstanding from trading and financial derivative activities.  \\\\n- Credit risk is the most important r isk to ADIB\\\\'s activity and therefore ADIB manages the credit \\\\nrisk exposures carefully. Management and control of ADIB\\\\'s credit risk shall focus on the retail \\\\nbanking credit risk management group and the institutions at the Risk Department, which reports \\\\nto the Risk Committee, Senior Management, Heads of Operation Department and BOD on interim \\\\nbasis.  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/1 Credit risk measurement  \\\\nFinancing and facilities to banks and customers (incl uding commitments and financial \\\\nguarantees)  \\\\nThe estimated exposure to credit  risk for purpose of credit risk management is complex, requiring the \\\\nuse of statistical and electronic models, as credit risk exposure varies with changes in market \\\\nconditions and other economic aspects in a complex and rapid manner. Exposure of credit ri sk \\\\nchanges with changes in the level, value, time of expected cash flows and over time. The credit risk \\\\nassessment of the asset portfolio, therefore, requires further estimates of the probability of default and \\\\nrelated loss rates. ADIB measures the credit risk losses using the rates of probability of failure (failure \\\\nto fulfil contractual obligations) (Probability of default) on the basis of the book balance of the \\\\nfinancial instrument at the date of failure (Exposure at default), and the rate of loss upon failure (Loss \\\\ngiven default).  \\\\n \\\\nADIB\\\\'s internal rating categories  \\\\n \\\\nClassification                Classification rating  \\\\n \\\\nStage (I)           Good Debts  \\\\nStage (II)                      Special Follow -up \\\\nStage (III)                      Bad Debts  \\\\n--- Page 36 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n36 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nClassification of the Credit Risks  \\\\nADIB assesses the probability of default on each customer / affiliated group / credit product, using \\\\nmethods to classify customers in different categories, ta king into account the minimum rating in \\\\naccordance with the CBE\\\\'s instructions on determining the creditworthiness of customers and the \\\\nformation of provisions issued during 2005. Accordingly, ADIB uses a group of models and methods \\\\nthat are internally des igned models and valuation methods for the counterparty categories and \\\\ncustomers and the nature of the various financings under the available information collected at the \\\\ndate of application of the used model (e.g. income level, spendable income level, gua rantees for \\\\nindividual customers, revenue, industry type, and other financial and non -financial indicators for \\\\ninstitutions). ADIB completes these indicators with a range of external data such as query reports \\\\nfrom CBE, credit reporting companies on borrow ers and reports of other domestic and foreign credit \\\\nrating agencies. In addition, the models used by ADIB shall allow the systematic assessment of \\\\nexperts by credit risk officers in the final internal credit rating. Thus, this allows to take into account \\\\nother matters and indicators that may not have been taken as part of other data inputs into evaluation \\\\nforms and methods designed internally or through external sources.  \\\\nCredit scores are calibrated so that the risk of failure increases incrementally with each higher risk \\\\nscore. This means that the difference in failure rates of grade A and A - is less than the difference in \\\\nfailure rates between grade B and B -. The following are additional considerations for each type of \\\\ncredit portfolios held by ADIB:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Individuals, Retail Banking Products and Small and Micro Enterprises  \\\\nAfter the date of initial recognition, the payment behaviour  of the borrower shall be monitored on \\\\nan interim basis to calculate a payment pattern. Any other known information about the borrower \\\\nidentified by ADIB may affect the creditworthiness such as unemployment rates and non -payment \\\\nprecedents as they will be included to measure the repayment pattern, and accordingly, default \\\\nrates will be determined for each scale of repayment pattern.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Large and Medium Enterprises   \\\\nThe rating is determined at the level of the  borrower / groups with similar credit risk, and any  \\\\nupdated or new credit information or assessments will be  included in the credit system on a \\\\ncontinuous and periodic basis. In addition, information on the creditworthiness of the borrower / \\\\ngroups with similar credit risk are periodically updated from oth er sources such as financial \\\\nstatements and other published financial and non -financial data. This will determine the degree of \\\\ninternal credit rating updated and failure rates.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Debt Instruments issued by the Egyptian Government and CBE  \\\\nDebt instruments, Treasury Bills and Government Bonds  \\\\n- ADIB uses external classifications of institutions that comply with the CBE\\\\'s instructions to manage \\\\nthe credit risk for debt instruments in the investment portfolio. These ratings are regularly monitored \\\\nand updated per iodically. The default rates associated with each rating are determined on the basis \\\\nof rates achieved over the previous 12 months as published by the aforementioned rating agencies. \\\\nThe loss rate for government debt instruments and the central bank in loc al currency equals zero.  \\\\n- ADIB\\\\'s rating of creditworthiness of government debt instruments, where the primary measure of \\\\neach rating category gives a specific range of probability of default, is stable over time. ADIB \\\\ncomplies with the internal rating categ ories alongside with the rating categories set by CBE \\\\naccording to the instructions of determining creditworthiness and the formation of provisions, and \\\\nreviewing that compliance on a regular basis. The rating methods are periodically re -calibrated and \\\\nvalidated to reflect the most recent projections in light of all assumptions observed in reality.  \\\\n--- Page 37 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n37 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/2 Future Data Used in the Expected Loss Model.  \\\\n- Future data is used to determine whether there is a significant increase in the credit risk of financial \\\\ninstruments and the estimated credit losses (ECL). ADIB management determines the key \\\\neconomic variables that affect the credit risk and credit losses expected for each credit portfolio by \\\\nanalysing  historical data. The economic variables and their impact are different on both Probability \\\\nof Default (PD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) depending on the \\\\ndifferent financial asset . ADIB seeks expert opinions regarding such assumptions and estimations, \\\\nif necessary.  \\\\n- Risk departments and credit departments of ADIB make estimates of these economic variables on \\\\na quarterly basis, and identify better estimations for those variables over  the next five years. After \\\\nthese five years, ADIB uses method of \\\"Mean Reversion Approach\\\" in estimating those variables \\\\nover the remaining life of each financial asset. Consequently, in the long term, those economic \\\\nvariables head to the level of the cur rently estimated averages or the estimated growth averages in \\\\nthe current period within a period of 2 -5 years.  \\\\n- In order to determine the impact of these economic variables on PD \\\"Probability of Default\\\", \\\\n\\\"Exposure at Default\\\" EAD and \\\"Loss Given Default\\\" LGD, ADIB\\\\'s management conducts the \\\\n\\\"Regression Analysis\\\" in order to understand the historical effects resulting from those variables \\\\non the default rates and the inputs used in calculating EAD and LGD.  \\\\n- In addition to basic economic scenarios, ADIB\\\\'s mana gement makes other possible scenarios, as \\\\nwell as the perceptions related to each scenario separately.  \\\\n- ADIB\\\\'s management conducts these economic scenarios for all important credit products in order \\\\nto ensure that all non - linarites variables are included.  These scenarios and their related \\\\ncharacteristics are reviewed at the financial position date.  \\\\n- Lifetime PD is used for both basic and other scenarios where the outcome of multiplying each \\\\nscenario is made with their respective probabilities, as well as th e supporting indicators and \\\\nqualitative indicators. Based on the results of this study, an estimate is made as to whether that \\\\nfinancial asset is at the first, second or third stage, on the basis of which it is determined whether \\\\nthe expected credit loss ( ECL) is calculated on a 12 -month basis or over the lifetime of the financial \\\\ninstrument \\\"Lifetime ECL\\\".  \\\\n- Expectations and probability of occurrence ate subject to highly uncertain degree as known for any \\\\neconomic expectations, so actual results may differ significantly from those expected. ADIB \\\\nconducts the best estimate of these potential projections and makes an analytical study of the \\\\nunrelated and non -similar factors for the various credit portfolios in order to arrive at appropriate \\\\nscenarios for all p ossible scenarios.  \\\\n--- Page 38 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n38 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nVariable Economic Assumptions  \\\\nThe following are the key year -end assumptions that have been used  to estimate ECL 31 December \\\\n2023. \\\\nEnterprises\\\\' Portfolio  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Gross domestic product (GDP).  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Stock Exchange Market Index  \\\\nIndividuals\\\\' Portfolio  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Gross domestic product (GDP).  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Private consumption  \\\\n- Balancing capital expenditures as a percentage of GDP.  \\\\nThe basic, downside, and upside scenarios were used for all portfolios.  \\\\nADIB did not use some future data other than the aforementioned, such as the impact of any \\\\nregulatory, legislative or political changes, due to not being considered to have a significant impact, \\\\nand therefore no adjustment was made to the ECL for these variables, w hich was reviewed and \\\\nmonitored to ensure their suitability on a quarterly basis.  \\\\nSensitivity Analysis  \\\\nThe main assumptions affecting the expected credit loss provision (ECL) are as follows  \\\\nIndividuals and Institutions Portfolio  \\\\nThe following represent the  most important sensitivity analysis used to estimate the expected credit \\\\nlosses as at 31 December 2023:  \\\\n- At least three scenarios are conducted to study future forecasts and to determine their impact on the \\\\nvariables of the expected credit loss measurem ent model. These scenarios represent:  \\\\n- Basic Scenario  \\\\n- Downside Scenario  \\\\n- Upside Scenario  \\\\n- The calculation of the expected credit loss reflects , without any bias, the probable weighted scenario, \\\\nwhich is determined based on the assessment of a range of expected results instead of reliance on \\\\nthe upside and downside scenarios.  \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 39 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n39 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nClassification of loss -related instruments measured on the basis of similar groups  \\\\nRegarding Expected Credit Losses “ECL”, groups are classified on the basis of similar credit risk \\\\ncharacteristics, so that risk at ADIB is homogenous.

These \\\\nrestructuring activities include arrangements to extend the repayment peri od, grace periods, \\\\nexemption from payment or some/or of the Profit s. Restructuring policies and practices are based \\\\non indicators or criteria that indicate - in management\\\\'s assessment - that payment will likely \\\\ncontinue. These policies remain under consta nt review.  \\\\n- ADIB continues to monitor whether there is a significant increase in credit risk with respect to those \\\\nassets through the use of specific models for the adjusted assets.  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/4  Risk limit control and mitigation policies  \\\\nADIB manages, limits and  controls concentrations of credit risk at the level of debtor, groups, \\\\nindustries and countries.  \\\\nADIB manages the credit risk it undertakes by placing limits on the amount of risk that will be \\\\naccepted at the level of each borrower or groups of borrowers and at the level of economic activities \\\\nand geographical sectors. Such risks are monitored on an ongoing basis and are subject to an annual \\\\nor frequent review when necessary. Limits at the level of borrower/ bank, product, sector and country \\\\nare approved q uarterly by the Board of Directors.  \\\\nThe exposure to any borrower including banks is further restricted by sub -limits covering on - and \\\\noff-the financial position exposures, and daily delivery risk limits in relation to trading items such as \\\\nforward Islamic foreign exchange contracts.  Actual exposures against limits are monitored daily.  \\\\nExposure to credit risk is also managed through regular analysis of the existing and potential \\\\nborrowers\\\\' ability to meet their obligations and through adjusting the financin g limits as appropriate.  \\\\nHere are some ways to limit risk:  \\\\nGuarantees  \\\\nADIB applies a range of policies controls to mitigate credit risk. One of these methods is obtaining \\\\nguarantees against the financed funds. ADIB establishes guidelines for specific categ ories of \\\\nacceptable guarantees.   \\\\nThe principal guarantees types for financing and facilities are:  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Cash and cash equivalents  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Real estate mortgages.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Commercial mortgages  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Financial instruments mortgage, such as debt and equity instruments.  \\\\nLong -term financing and corporate lending are often secured, while credit facilities for individuals \\\\nare unsecured. To reduce credit loss to a minimum, ADIB seeks additional guarantees from the \\\\nconcerned parties as soon as impairment indicators are noticed for any f inancing or facilities.  \\\\nADIB determines the collaterals held to guarantee assets other than financing and facilities according \\\\nto the nature of the instrument. Generally, debt instruments and treasury bills are unsecured except \\\\nfor asset -backed securities and similar instruments that are secured by a financial instruments \\\\nportfolio.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 41 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n41 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\nCredit -related commitments  \\\\nCredit -related commitments represent the unused portion of credit limit authorised to grant financing, \\\\nguarantees or letters of credit.  ADIB is exposed to a possible loss of an amount that equals the total \\\\nunused commitments as for the credit risk resulting from credit -related commitments.  However, the \\\\nprobable amount of loss is less than the unused commi tments as most commitments related to \\\\ngranting credit represent contingent liabilities to customers maintaining certain credit standards. \\\\nADIB monitors the maturity date of the credit commitments because long -term commitments are of \\\\na higher credit risk th an short -term commitments.  \\\\n4/1/5  Impairment and provisioning policies  \\\\nThe aforementioned internal rating systems focus more on credit quality planning as of the date \\\\nfinancing  and investment activities are recognized. Otherwise, impairment losses that occur at the \\\\nfinancial statements date are only recognised for financial reports purposes based on objective \\\\nevidence indicating impairment according to what will be mentioned in this note. Due to the different \\\\nmethodologies applied, the amounts of incurred credit losses charged to the financial statements are \\\\nusually lower than the estimated loss amount using the expected loss model used for purposes of the \\\\nrules the Central Bank of Egypt.  \\\\nThe impairment loss provision included in the financial statements at the end of the year is derived \\\\nfrom the four internal ratings. However, the majority of the provision is derived from the last rating. \\\\nThe following table shows the percentage of the items within the financial statements for the period \\\\nended 31 December 2023  related to financing, facilities, and related impairment for each of ADIB\\\\'s \\\\ninternal assessment categories:  \\\\n \\\\nThe internal rating tools assist the management to determine whether there is evidence of impairment \\\\nunder EAS 47, based on the following criteria set out by ADIB:  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Significant financial difficulty of the customer or the debtor.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Breach of the financing agr eement conditions such as default.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Expected bankruptcy of the customer, entering into a liquidation lawsuit, or restructuring the \\\\nfinance granted to the customer.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Deterioration of the competitive position of the customer.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Granting privileges or assignments  by ADIB to the customer due to economic or legal reasons \\\\nrelated to the financial difficulties of the borrower, which are not granted by ADIB in the normal \\\\ncourse of business.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Impairment of the guarantee.  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Deterioration of creditworthiness.  \\\\n--- Page 42 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n42 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n4/1/6 Impairment and provisions policies - continued  \\\\nADIB’s policies require reviewing all financial assets that exceed specific materiality at least once a \\\\nyear or more, when required. The impairment loss is determined for accounts evaluated on an \\\\nindividual basis by determining case -by-case actual losses at the financial statements date. These \\\\npolicies are applied on all accounts which have specific materiality on an individual basis. The \\\\nvaluation usually includes the exis ting guarantee, the related enforcements on these guarantees and \\\\nthe expected collections from those accounts.  \\\\nA provision is made for impairment losses on the basis of the group of similar assets using the \\\\navailable historical experience, personal judgmen t and statistical techniques.  \\\\n \\\\n4/1/7 General banking risk measurement model  \\\\n \\\\nIn addition to ADIB\\\\'s four internal rating categories described above, the management classifies loans \\\\nand facilities in the form of more detailed sub -groups in line with the req uirements of the Central \\\\nBank of Egypt. The assets exposed to credit risk in these groups are classified according to detailed \\\\nrules and conditions that rely heavily on information related to customer\\\\'s business, financial position \\\\nand regularity of paymen t. \\\\nADIB calculates the provisions required to offset the impairment of assets exposed to credit risk, \\\\nincluding credit -related commitments, on the basis of ratios set by the Central Bank of Egypt. In case \\\\nof the excess of the provision for impairment losse s required in accordance with the creditworthiness \\\\nrules of the Central Bank of Egypt over the provision required to use the expected credit losses, such \\\\nexcess in  the provision is set aside as a general banking risk reserve within equity to be deducted \\\\nagainst retained earnings by the amount of that excess.  \\\\nThe following is a description of the creditworthiness categories of the institutions according to the \\\\nprinciples for determining the creditworthiness of customers in accordance with the instructions o f \\\\nthe Central Bank of Egypt in this regard and the percentage of provisions required for the impairment \\\\nof assets exposed to credit risk:  \\\\nCBE rating  Rating  \\\\ndescription  Required \\\\nprovision %  Internal \\\\nrating  Internal rating \\\\ndescription  \\\\n1 Low risk  Zero  1 Good  debts  \\\\n2 Moderate risk  1% 1 Good debts  \\\\n3 Satisfactory risk  1% 1 Good debts  \\\\n4 Appropriate risk  2% 1 Good debts  \\\\n5 Acceptable risk  2% 1 Good debts  \\\\n6 Marginally \\\\nacceptable risk  3% 1 Regular watch up  \\\\n7 Risk needs special \\\\nattention  5% 2 Special watch up  \\\\n8 Substandard  20% 3 Non-performing \\\\ndebts  \\\\n9 Doubtful  50% 3 Non-performing \\\\ndebts  \\\\n10 \\\\n Bad debts  100%  3 Non-performing \\\\ndebts  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 43 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n43 \\\\n Financial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n4/1/8 Maximum limit for credit risk before guarantees  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02d The previous table represents the maximum exposure on 31 December 2023, without taking any \\\\nguarantees into consideration.

The market risk arises from the open positions of the Profit  rate and the currency, \\\\nas each is exposed to general and priva te movements in the market and changes in the level of sensitivity \\\\nto market rates or prices such as rates of Profit  and exchange rates. ADIB separates its exposure to market \\\\nrisk to trading or non -trading portfolios.  \\\\nThe management of market risk arising from trading or non -trading activities is concentrated in ADIB\\\\'s \\\\nrisk management and is monitored by two separate teams. Market risk reports are reported to the Risk \\\\nCommittee of the Board of Directors and heads of operating units on a regular basis.  \\\\nThe p ortfolios of financial investments at fair value through profit or loss include those positions resulting \\\\nfrom ADIB\\\\'s direct dealing with customers or with the market, while non -trading portfolios arise primarily \\\\nfrom managing the Profit  rate on assets and  liabilities. These portfolios include foreign exchange risk and \\\\nequity instruments arising from financial investments at amortized cost and financial investments at fair \\\\nvalue through other comprehensive income.  \\\\n \\\\n4/2/1 Market risk measurement techniques  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 As part of market risk management, ADIB undertakes various hedging strategies. ADIB also enters \\\\ninto swaps to match the Profit  rate risk associated with the debt instruments and fixed -rate long -term \\\\nfinancing if the fair value option has been applied. The m ajor measurement techniques used to control \\\\nmarket risk are outlined below:  \\\\n \\\\n Value at risk  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 ADIB applies a ‘value at risk’ methodology (VAR) for trading and non -trading portfolios to estimate \\\\nthe market risk on positions held and the maximum expected losses based on a number of assumptions \\\\nfor various changes in market conditions.  The Board sets  separate limits for the value of risk that may \\\\nbe accepted by ADIB for trading and non -trading portfolios and are monitored daily by ADIB’s market \\\\nrisk management.   \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 VAR is a statistical estimation of the expected losses on the current portfolio resulting  from adverse \\\\nmarket movements, which represent the maximum amount ADIB expects to lose using a confidence \\\\nlevel of (98%).  Therefore, there is a statistical probability of (2%) that actual losses could be greater \\\\nthan the VAR estimation.  The VAR model as sumes that the holding period is ten days before closing \\\\nthe open positions. It is also assumed that the market movement during the holding period will follow \\\\nthe same pattern of movement that occurred during the previous ten days. ADIB estimates the previ ous \\\\nmovement based on data for the previous five years. ADIB applies these historical changes in rates, \\\\nprices, indicators, etc., directly to its current positions. This approach is called historical simulation. \\\\nActual outcomes are monitored regularly to t est the validity of the assumptions and factors used in the \\\\nVAR calculation.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 The use of that technique does not prevent the loss to exceed those limits in the case of a larger \\\\nmovement in the market.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 As VAR is considered a primary part of ADIB’s market ris k control technique, VAR limits are \\\\nestablished by the Assets and Liabilities Committee regularly for all trading and non -trading \\\\ntransactions and allocated to business units. Actual VAR are compared to the limits set by ADIB and \\\\nreviewed daily by ADIB’s r isk management. The quality of the VAR model is continuously monitored \\\\nthrough enhanced VAR testing of the trading portfolio and the results of the tests are submitted to the \\\\nAssets and Liabilities Committee.  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 The quality of VAR model is monitored on an ongoing basis by reinforced tests to the results of the \\\\nVAR of trading portfolio, and the results of tests are reported to the senior management and Board of \\\\nDirectors.  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 53 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n53 \\\\n \\\\nFinancial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n \\\\nStress testing  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Stress testing provides an indicator of the expected losses that may arise from sharp adverse \\\\ncircumstances. Stress testing is designed to match the business using standard analysis for specific \\\\nscenarios. The stress testing carried out by the risk management include risk factor str ess testing where \\\\nsharp movements are applied to each risk category and emerging markets stress tests, as emerging \\\\nmarkets are subject to sharp movements and special stress tests, including possible stress events \\\\naffecting specific positions or regions, su ch as what may arise in a certain region due to applying a \\\\nfree rate on a certain currency. The results of the stress testing are reviewed by the top management \\\\nand the Board of Directors.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 Stress testing related to exchange rate  \\\\nThe following table shows the position of the currencies (surplus or deficit) of the items inside and \\\\noutside the balance sheet  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n4/2/2 VAR summary  \\\\nTotal value at risk by the type of risk  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 54 ---\\\\n ABU DHABI  ISLAMIC  BANK  (ADIB) – EGYPT  – S.A.E  \\\\nNotes to the separate financial statements  \\\\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023  \\\\n54 \\\\n \\\\nFinancial risk Management -Continued  \\\\n4/2/3  Risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  \\\\n\\\\uf0a7 ADIB is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows.

Fair value Profit  rate risk is the risk that  \\\\nthe value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market Profit  rates. The Profit  \\\\nmargin may increase due to these changes; however, profits may decrease in case unexpected \\\\nmovements arise. The ALCO Committee sets limits on the leve l of mismatch of Profit  rate repricing that \\\\nADIB may maintain, which is monitored daily by ADIB’s risk management.  \\\\n \\\\nProfit  rate structure risk management system  \\\\nRisk assessment, limits and corrective procedures are undertaken by the Asset -Liability Committee \\\\n(ALCO) under the chairmanship of the President of ADIB, the membership of the Executive Directors, \\\\nthe CFO, Directors of Commercial Departments, the Branch Ne twork Manager, the Secretary General \\\\nand the President of the International Transaction Chamber.

It \\\\nstarts with a discussion on the concept and importance of corporate governance, followed \\\\nby a review of the various as pects of the capital market, in cluding the structure of the \\\\nstock market, the legal and supervisory fr amework, registration requirements, and the \\\\nownership structure. The paper then assesses Egypt’s corporate governance standards in \\\\naccordance with the five OECD principles, namely, shareholders’ rights, equitable \\\\ntreatment of shareholders, stakeholders’ role  in corporate governance, disclosure and \\\\ntransparency, and responsibilities of the board of directors. \\\\nThe analysis shows that corporate gove rnance standards in Egypt have improved \\\\nsignificantly, as reflected in the overall asse ssment of all five OECD principles. The \\\\ndegree of progress, however, varies from one principle to another. Finally, the paper points out that Egyptian companies are stil l far from properly implementing corporate \\\\ngovernance principles.  \\\\n \\\\nﻤﻠﺨﺹ \\\\nﻤﺼﺭ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ ﻟﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﻨﻅﻤﺔ  ﻭﺍﻟﻤﻌﺎﻴﻴﺭ  ﻭﺍﻟﻘﻭﺍﻨﻴﻥ  ﺍﻟﻘﻭﺍﻋﺩ ﺘﻘﻴﻴﻡ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﻫﺫﻩ ﺘﻬﺩﻑ .  ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﻭﺘﺒﺩﺃ\\\\n ﻫﻴﻜل ﺤﻴﺙ ﻤﻥ ﺍﻟﻤﺎل، ﻟﺴﻭﻕ ﺍﻟﻤﺨﺘﻠﻔﺔ  ﺍﻟﺠﻭﺍﻨﺏ ﺘﺘﻨﺎﻭل ﺜﻡ ﻭﺃﻫﻤﻴﺘﻪ،  ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﻤﻔﻬﻭﻡ ﺒﻤﻨﺎﻗﺸﺔ\\\\nﺍﻟﻤﺎﻟﻴﺔ، ﺍﻷﻭﺭﺍﻕ  ﺴﻭﻕ ﻴﺤﻜﻡ ﺍﻟﺫﻱ ﻭﺍﻟﺭﻗﺎﺒﻲ  ﺍﻟﻘﺎﻨﻭﻨﻲ  ﻭﺍﻹﻁﺎﺭ  ﺍﻟﺒﻭﺭﺼﺔ،   ﻓﻲ ﻭﺍﻟﻘﻴﺩ ﺍﻟﺘﺴﺠﻴل  ﻭﻤﺘﻁﻠﺒﺎﺕ\\\\nﺍﻟﻤﺎﻟﻴﺔ ﺍﻷﻭﺭﺍﻕ  ﻤﻠﻜﻴﺔ ﻭﻫﻴﻜل ﺍﻟﺒﻭﺭﺼﺔ،  ﺠﺩﺍﻭل .  ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ  ﻗﻭﺍﻋﺩ ﺘﻁﻭﺭ ﺘﻘﻴﻴﻡ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺫﻟﻙ ﺒﻌﺩ ﺘﻨﺘﻘل ﺜﻡ\\\\n ﻋﺎﻡ ﻭﺍﻟﺘﻨﻤﻴﺔ ﺍﻻﻗﺘﺼﺎﺩﻱ  ﺍﻟﺘﻌﺎﻭﻥ ﻤﻨﻅﻤﺔ ﻭﻀﻌﺘﻬﺎ  ﺍﻟﺘﻲ ﺍﻟﺨﻤﺱ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﻟﻤﻌﺎﻴﻴﺭ ﻭﻓﻘﺎ ﻤﺼﺭ\\\\nﻭﻫﻲ٩٩٩١ ،:  ﻟﻠﻤ ﺍﻟﻤﺘﺴﺎﻭﻴﺔ  ﺍﻟﻤﻌﺎﻤﻠﺔ  ﺍﻟﻤﺴﺎﻫﻤﻴﻥ،  ﺤﻘﻭﻕ  ﺍﻷﻁﺭﺍﻑ  ﺃﻭ ﺍﻟﻤﺼﺎﻟﺢ  ﺃﺼﺤﺎﺏ  ﺩﻭﺭ ﺴﺎﻫﻤﻴﻥ،\\\\nﺍﻹﺩﺍﺭﺓ ﻤﺠﻠﺱ ﻭﻤﺴﺅﻭﻟﻴﺎﺕ  ﻭﺍﻟﺸﻔﺎﻓﻴﺔ،  ﺍﻹﻓﺼﺎﺡ  ﺒﺎﻟﺸﺭﻜﺔ،  ﺍﻟﻤﺭﺘﺒﻁﺔ.   \\\\n ﻗﻭﺍﻋﺩ ﺇﺭﺴﺎﺀ ﻤﺠﺎل ﻓﻲ ﻤﻠﺤﻭﻅﺎ ﺘﻁﻭﺭﺍ ﺸﻬﺩ ﻗﺩ ﻤﺼﺭ ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﻤﺎل ﺴﻭﻕ ﺃﻥ ﺇﻟﻰ ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﺨﻠﺼﺕ ﻭﻗﺩ\\\\nﺍﻟﺨﻤﺱ ﻟﻠﻤﻌﺎﻴﻴﺭ  ﺍﻹﺠﻤﺎﻟﻲ  ﺍﻟﺘﻘﻴﻴﻡ ﻓﻲ ﺘﺤﺴﻥ ﻋﺎﻡ ﺒﺸﻜل ﻋﻠﻴﻪ ﺘﺭﺘﺏ ﻤﻤﺎ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ، ﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ  ،ﻟﻠﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ  ﻭﺇﻥ\\\\nﻵﺨﺭ ﻤﻌﻴﺎﺭ ﻤﻥ ﺍﺨﺘﻠﻔﺕ ﻗﺩ ﺍﻟﺘﺤﺴﻥ ﺩﺭﺠﺔ ﻜﺎﻨﺕ.  ﺃﻭﻀﺤ ﻜﻤﺎ  ﺍﻟﻭﺭﻗﺔ ﺃﻨﺕ  ﺃﻴﻀﺎ  ﺘﺤﺴﻥ ﻤﻥ ﺍﻟﺭﻏﻡ ﻋﻠﻰ ﻪ\\\\n ﺇﻟﻰ ﻤﺎﺯﺍﻟﺕ ﻟﻠﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﺍﻟﻌﻤﻠﻴﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﻤﺎﺭﺴﺎﺕ ﺃﻥ ﺇﻻ ﻤﺼﺭ، ﻓﻲ ﺍﻟﺸﺭﻜﺎﺕ  ﻟﺤﻭﻜﻤﺔ ﻭﺍﻟﻤﺅﺴﺴﻲ  ﺍﻟﻘﺎﻨﻭﻨﻲ ﺍﻹﻁﺎﺭ\\\\nﺍﻟﻤﻭﻀﻭﻋﺔ  ﻟﻠﻤﺒﺎﺩﺉ ﺍﻟﺴﻠﻴﻡ ﺍﻟﺘﻁﺒﻴﻕ ﻋﻥ ﺒﻌﻴﺩﺓ ﻜﺒﻴﺭ ﺤﺩ. \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 3 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nTable of Contents \\\\n \\\\nHighlights  \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction: The Concept of Corporate Governance and Its Importance \\\\n \\\\nPreliminary Section: Comprehensive Vi ew of the Capital Market in Egypt \\\\n  Stock Market Structure  \\\\n  Legal and Supervisory Framework \\\\nRegistration and Listing Requirements Ownership Structure \\\\nPart 1:  Shareholders’ Rights \\\\n1/1  Fundamental Rights \\\\n1/2   The General Assembly Meetings and Disclosure of Financial Statements  \\\\nPart 2: Equitable Treatment of Shareholders \\\\n2/1  Voting Rights  \\\\n2/2  Participation in the Company’s Fundamental Decisions \\\\n2/3  Follow-Up and Supervision of Companies \\\\n2/4  Insider Trading and Self-Dealing \\\\n2/5  Deals with Related Parties \\\\nPart 3: Stakeholders’ Role  in Corporate Governance \\\\n3/1  Report of Legal Rights  \\\\n3/2  Compensation for Rights Violation \\\\n3/3  Mechanisms to Promote Stakeholders’ Participation  \\\\n3/4  Access to Information \\\\nPart 4: Disclosure  and Transparency \\\\n4/1  Disclosure of Important Information \\\\n4/2  The Auditor 4/3  Disclosing Ownership of  the Majority of Shares \\\\n4/4  Disclosure for Board Members and Executive Directors \\\\n4/5  Disclosure of Other Information \\\\nPart 5: Responsibilities of the Board of Directors \\\\n5/1  Structure and Legal Responsibilities \\\\n5/2  Selection of Board Members \\\\n5/3  Main Responsibilities \\\\n5/4  Independent Supervision \\\\nConclusion: Main Results and Recommendations \\\\nAnnexes  \\\\nReferences\\\\n \\\\n--- Page 4 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nHighlights \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Corporate governance refers to the rules,  laws and standard s that define the \\\\nrelationship between the company’s ma nagement and its shareholders and \\\\nstakeholders or related parties, name ly the bondholders, workers, suppliers, \\\\ncreditors and consumers. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 This report – which was conducted by th e Egyptian Center for Economic Studies \\\\nin cooperation with the Ministry of Fore ign Trade, the Capital Market Authority \\\\nand the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Excha nges – aims to evaluate the laws and \\\\nrules that ensure the proper applicat ion of corporate governance in Egypt. The \\\\nevaluation was based on the institutiona l development of corporate governance \\\\nstandards in Egypt in comparison with th e five OECD principles issued by the \\\\nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development in 1999. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Review of the laws governing the capital market in E gypt showed that the legal \\\\nframework that regulates corporate govern ance rules and principles in Egypt is \\\\nbased on the French civil law of companies.  There is no direct effect of Islamic \\\\nShari’a (legislation) on such rules. On  the other hand, the Anglo-American law \\\\naffects the central depository and registry law and the draft capital market law, \\\\nwhich is due to be referred to the People’s Assembly (Parliament) for discussion. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Capital Market Authority (CMA) is the main party responsible for capital \\\\nmarket regulation and supervision with the help of the Cairo and Alexandria \\\\nStock Exchanges (CASE) and the Egyp tian Clearance and Central Depositing \\\\nCompany. Other non-profit or self-regulator y institutions play supporting roles in \\\\nthis respect. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 In Egypt, there is one stock market with  two premises for trading: Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria, which include four listing tables. The number of listed companies \\\\nrose from 656 in 1992 to 1,151 in December 2002. The market value rose from 8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP ) in 1992 to 32 percent in 2002. Trading \\\\nvalue/market capital rose from 3.4 pe rcent in 1992 to 21 percent in 2002.  \\\\n1 \\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Developments in the Capital Market and the Cairo and Alexandria Stock \\\\nExchanges indicate that the peri od from September 2001 to March 2003 \\\\nwitnessed considerable improvement in instituting corporate governance rules in \\\\nEgypt. This resulted in a general improve ment in the overall assessment of these \\\\nrules. The evaluation showed improvement in the five principles of corporate \\\\ngovernance, with varying degrees of improve ment from one principle to another. \\\\nAccording to the assessment, the five principles of corporate governance in Egypt \\\\nmay be classified in descending order ba sed on their degree of conformity with \\\\nthe international principles as follows: st akeholders’ role in corporate governance, \\\\nequitable treatment of shareholders, shareholder\\\\'s rights, disclosure and \\\\ntransparency, and responsibilities of the board  of director. It is possible to refer to \\\\nsome procedures that led to such an overall improvement in the assessment, including the issuance of new rules for listing and disclosure that are in harmony \\\\nwith the international principles, which ar e related to the comp any’s profitability, \\\\nnumber of shareholders and minimum limit of share capital. The rules of \\\\ndisclosure were also developed and co mpanies were obliged to form auditing \\\\ncommittees and to appoint an officer respons ible for relations with investors. The \\\\nprocedures also include the establis hment of a settlements guarantee fund, \\\\nallowing the registered owner to vote on be half of the beneficiary owner and per \\\\nthe former\\\\'s instructions, and allowing  voting through ordina ry and electronic \\\\nmail. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The report concluded that there are certa in rules that need more improvement \\\\nsuch as protecting minority shareholders’ ri ghts, providing strict control to ensure \\\\nthat the board of directors performs  its responsibilities, emphasizing the \\\\nimportance of disclosure in all the detail s of the ownership st ructure, as well as \\\\ncompleting the legal framework and strengthening the supervisory institutions’ \\\\ncapacities. The report also showed that there is still a need for improving the application of these standard s among Egyptian companies.  \\\\n2 \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nIntroduction: The Concept of Corporate Governance and Its Importance  \\\\nGenerally speaking, the concept of corporate governance refers  to the rules, laws and \\\\nstandards that define the relationship between a company’ s management on one hand and \\\\nits shareholders and stakeholders, namely the bondholders, workers, suppliers, creditors \\\\nand consumers, on the other hand. More strictly, the term “corporate governance” \\\\nprovides answers to many questions including : How can the owners make sure that the \\\\nmanagement does not misuse their money? How can they make sure that the management \\\\nacts towards maximizing the company’s share value and profitability in the long run? How much does the management care about the basic interests of the society such as \\\\nhealth and environment? And lastly, how can shareholders and stakeholders effectively \\\\nsupervise the management? \\\\nThe term corporate governance raises so me ambiguity for three main reasons \\\\nrelated to the modernity of the term itself. Th e first reason is that the roots of the concept \\\\nof corporate governance and many of the issues linked with it go back to the beginning of \\\\nthe 19\\\\nth century and were dealt with by some or ganization and management theories as \\\\nwell as the “enterprise theory.” The term itself started to be used in the English language and its concepts began to crystallize only two or three decades ago. The second reason is that there is no definite meaning for this concept. Some people consider it to be a \\\\nmechanism that allows companies to get financ ing and to magnify the value of its shares \\\\nand secure its continuity in the long run. Others define it fr om a legal pers pective as the \\\\ncontractual relationship (be it complete or in complete) which defines the rights and duties \\\\nof the shareholders and the stakeholders on one hand, and of the managers on the other \\\\nhand. Another group may look at it from a social and moral viewpoint and hence \\\\nconcentrate on the company’s social responsibil ity to protect the ri ghts of the minority \\\\nshareholders or junior investors, to realize equitable so cioeconomic developments and \\\\nprotect the environment. The th ird and last reason behind th e vagueness of this term is \\\\nthat the concept itself is still in its formation stage, and its principles  and rules continue to \\\\nbe revised and developed. \\\\nNevertheless, there is a sort of ag reement between the researchers and \\\\npractitioners on the major determinants and eval uation criteria of this concept. As for the \\\\n3 \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ndeterminants, it is agreed that, good or bad, governance depends on the presence and \\\\nquality of two groups of determinants: external and internal (see Figure 1). External determinants refer to the general investment climate in the state, including: laws that \\\\nregulate market performance (such as capital market, companies, competition and anti-trust, and bankruptcy laws); th e efficiency of the financial sector (the banks and capital \\\\nmarket) in providing the necessary financi ng for projects; the competitiveness of the \\\\ncommodities markets and the factors of production, and the efficiency of the supervisory bodies and authorities (the Capital Market  Authority and the Stock Exchange) in \\\\nexercising strict control over the companies. This is in addition to some self-regulating \\\\ninstitutions that ensure the markets’ e fficient performance (such as professional \\\\nassociations that provide vari ous codes of ethics for the market participants such as \\\\nauditors, accountants, lawyers, companies worki ng in the securities market, etc.). There \\\\nare also institutions for inde pendent professions such as law offices, auditing offices, \\\\ncredit rating offices and financial and investment consulta tion offices. The presence of \\\\nexternal determinants is important for providing a sound corporate governance \\\\nenvironment and ensuring the enforcement of  laws and rules that reduce the conflict \\\\nbetween social and private returns. \\\\nInternal determinants, on the other hand, refer to rules and principles that \\\\ndetermine the decision-making process and the division of responsibilities among the \\\\ngeneral assembly, the board members, and the executive directors of the company. The \\\\npresence and the application of these rules a nd principles reduce the conflicts of interest \\\\nbetween those three parties. \\\\n \\\\n      \\\\n4 \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nFigure 1: External and Internal Determinants  \\\\n \\\\n         External Determinants                             Internal Determinants  \\\\n \\\\n          Organizational                            Private \\\\n \\\\nCriteria  \\\\nAccounting \\\\nAuditing Others \\\\nLaws and rules  Stakeholders        Shareholders  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n     Board of Directors  \\\\n  \\\\nAppoints           Reports \\\\n      &    to \\\\nSupervises \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n     \\\\n          Management\\\\n \\\\n          Performs basic \\\\n              functions  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\nFinancial Sector  \\\\nLoans \\\\nShare capital \\\\n   participation Private Institutions * \\\\n \\\\nAccountants and \\\\nauditors \\\\nLawyers \\\\nCredit rating \\\\nInvestment banks \\\\nConsultation \\\\nFinancial analysis \\\\nFinancial information  \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\nMarkets  \\\\nMarket Competitiveness \\\\nForeign Direct     Investment \\\\nCompanies Supervision  \\\\n \\\\n   \\\\n   * Private institutions refer to the private sector elements, self-management entities, mass media  \\\\n   organizations, civil society and agencies that provide information, raise the level of control over \\\\n   companies and shed light on the opportunist behavior of the management. \\\\n   Source: Iskander and Chamlou (2000). \\\\n \\\\nIn 1999, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \\\\nlaid out five sets of princi ples as guidelines to assess th e level of corporate governance \\\\napplication:1 \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Rights of Shareholders: These include the rights to  transfer the ownership \\\\nof their shares, to vote in  the general assembly, to select board members, to \\\\nreceive dividends from their shares, to revi se financial statements and the right to \\\\nactive participation in the general assembly meetings. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Equitable Treatment of Shareholders : This means equal treatment of \\\\nshareholders in all categories and the defens e of their legal rights, as well as their \\\\nright to vote in the general assembly on fundamental decisions, to be protected \\\\n                                                 \\\\n1  OECD is revising these principles. Revised principles are expected to be issued before the end of 2003. \\\\n5 \\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nagainst any suspicious mergers or acquisitions and from insider trading, as well as \\\\ntheir right to be informed of all transactions involvi ng the board members or the \\\\nexecutive managers. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Role of Stakeholders in Corporate Governance : This includes the respect \\\\nof their legal rights and compensating them for any breach of these rights. It also includes mechanisms to enhance their pa rticipation in supervising the company \\\\nand access to the required information. Stakeholders include the bond-holders, workers, banks, suppliers and customers. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 Disclosure and Transparency : This includes the disclo sure of key information, \\\\nthe role of the auditor, a nd the ownership of the major ity of shares, as well as \\\\ndisclosure related to the board members and executives. Disclosure should take place in a timely manner and without dela y and will be conducted fairly among \\\\nshareholders and stakeholders alike. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\x83 The Responsibilities of the Board : These include its structure, its legal duties, \\\\nthe board member selection process, its ma in functions and its supervisory role of \\\\nthe executive management. \\\\nCorporate governance is important because, if applied properly, it helps to realize \\\\nhigh and sustainable growth rates. It increases confidence in the national economy, \\\\ndeepens capital market and increases its ability to mobilize savings and raise investment \\\\nrates. Moreover, it protects the rights of the minority shar eholders or small investors. \\\\nCorporate governance also enc ourages the growth of the pr ivate sector by supporting its \\\\ncompetitive capabilities, helping to secure financing for projects, generating profits and creating job opportunities.  \\\\nCorporate governance has been gaining increasing importance over the last two \\\\ndecades for several reasons. First and fore most, the switch by many of the world\\\\'s \\\\ncountries to capitalist economic systems that  rely greatly on private companies for the \\\\nrealization of high and sustainable economic gr owth rates. The expansion of these private \\\\nprojects led to a separation between corporate ownership an d management. As a result, \\\\n6 \\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nprojects started looking for financial sources that were less expensive than banks, so they \\\\nheaded to the capital markets. This was made easier by the liberalization of capital \\\\nmarkets in many parts of the world. Capital began to move across borders at \\\\nunprecedented rates. The expansion of project  volumes and the separation of ownership \\\\nfrom management weakened supervisory mech anisms on managers’ behavior and caused \\\\nmany companies to fall into financial distress.  The most serious of these was the South \\\\nEast Asian crisis at the end of the 1990s, which was followed by other crises involving \\\\ncompanies such as the Enron and WorldCom in the US in 2001. All these factors placed \\\\ncorporate governance at the top of the worl d concerns. Discussions were held in an \\\\nattempt to mend the deficiencies in the pr inciples and rules regulating companies’ \\\\nactivities, especially those concerned with  the role of financial auditors and the \\\\nresponsibilities of the board of directors. \\\\nEgypt started to give due importance to  the subject of corporate governance in \\\\n2001 with an initiative taken by the Minist ry of Economy and Foreign Trade (now the \\\\nMinistry of Foreign Trade). The Ministry wa s of the opinion that  the economic reform \\\\nprogram initiated in the early 90s could only be completed by installing an organizational \\\\nand supervisory framework that governs the pr ivate sector performance in the context of \\\\nliberalized markets. A study was conducted to a ssess the extent of th e conformity of the \\\\nEgyptian legal, regulatory and supervisory fr amework to the international criteria of \\\\ncorporate governance. The study aimed to trace and assess development achieved during the period from September 2001 to March 2003 in  completing the rules and determinants \\\\nthat ensure the proper application of corporat e governance in Egypt.  \\\\nThe following sections of this report include  an overview of the various aspects of \\\\nthe capital market as well as five main secti ons that assess the development of corporate \\\\ngovernance in Egypt according to the five principles introduced by OECD in 1999.  \\\\n \\\\nPreliminary Section: Comprehensive Vi ew of the Capital Market in Egypt\\\\n \\\\nThis section deals with the vari ous aspects of the capital market  such as the activity of the \\\\nStock Exchange, the legal and supervisory fr amework that governs corporate operations \\\\nand finally, the ownership stru cture of the traded shares. \\\\n7 \\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nStock Market Structure \\\\nEgypt\\\\'s Stock Exchange dates back to the 19th century. The Alexandria and Cairo Stock \\\\nExchanges were officially established in 1883 and 1903, respectively. Both exchanges \\\\nwere very active in the 1940s, and ranked fifth in the world.2  In spite of their dormancy \\\\nbeginning in the 1960s, they were never clos ed. They were revived in the early 1990s \\\\nwhen the government adopted an integrat ed program for rest ructuring economic \\\\nstabilization; especially af ter the issuance of Law No. 95/1992. Egypt\\\\'s Stock Exchange \\\\nis comprised of two trading exchanges, one in Cairo and the second in Alexandria. \\\\nSecurities are automatically registered in both exchanges and listing fees are mutually \\\\ndivided. \\\\nIn December 2002 there were about 29,000 a ssociations of capital in Egypt \\\\nincluding about 22,000 joint stock companies,  280 limited-by-shares companies, and \\\\n7,000 limited liability companies.3  The legal framework allows for listing only joint \\\\nstock companies and limited-by-shares co mpanies. Listed companies enjoy tax \\\\nexemption equivalent to the value of the paid-in capital multiplied by the interest rate, which is decided by the Central Bank of Egypt  every three months. The number of listed \\\\nbusinesses rose from 656 companies in 1992 to 1,151 companies in December 2002. While the legal framework for companies’ continued listing in the Stock Exchange \\\\nrequires at least one trading operation per company every six months, it is difficult to \\\\nsubstantiate this requirement.\\\\n4  Market capitalization incr eased from approximately LE \\\\n11 billion in 1992 (8 percent of the GDP) to LE 123 billion in 2002 (32 percent of the \\\\nGDP).5  The value of traded shares rose fr om LE 371 million in 1992 (3.4 percent of the \\\\nmarket capital value) to r each a peak of LE 42 billion in 2000 (35 percent of the market \\\\ncapital value) then declined to LE 26 million in 2002 (21 percent of the market capital \\\\nvalue) due to domestic and global events. \\\\n                                                 \\\\n2 Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (http:/www.mbendi.Co.za/exch/12/p005.htm). \\\\n3 Stock Exchange Monthly Bulletin , January 2003 and Report of the Ministry of Foreign Trade on Egypt’s \\\\nStock Market performance during 2002. \\\\n4 Such operations are mostly performed by individuals related to the company just to keep it listed. \\\\n5 Annex No. 1 shows Stock Exchange performance development from January 1992 to December 2002. \\\\n8 \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nTo date, nine Egyptian companies are listed on the London, Luxembourg and \\\\nFrankfurt Stock Exchanges through th e Global Depository Receipts (GDR).6  GDR \\\\ntrading value reached Pound Sterling 440 million in 2002. As of January 2003, there were \\\\n13 mergers among listed companies, and 108 pur chasing and acquisition cases involving \\\\ncompanies from the real estate, tourism, pharmaceutical, banks, energy, insurance, \\\\ncement, communications, food and beverage sect ors. International companies represented \\\\nmore than one-third of the buyers.7  Several indexes are used for measuring the \\\\ndevelopment of Cairo and Alexandria Stock Ex changes the most important of which are: \\\\nthe Capital Market Authority Index; CASE 30 issued by Cairo and Alexandria Stock \\\\nExchanges in March 2003; Standard & Poor’s ; Morgan Stanley MS Investible Index, in \\\\naddition to indexes for dome stic financial enterprises.8 \\\\nLegal and Supervisory Framework \\\\nThe legal and supervisory framework includes all the laws that gove rn the securities \\\\nmarket in Egypt and the supervisory agencies that regulate its market activity. The \\\\nfollowing is a short description of the most important laws and agencies. \\\\nLegal System \\\\nThe Egyptian legal system is largely influen ced by the French Civil Law. However, the \\\\nlaws governing capital market performance, su ch as the Central Depository Law and the  \\\\nCapital Market Law, are based on the Anglo- American Law. The major laws regulating \\\\ncapital market performance are outlined below. \\\\nThe Capital Market Law (No. 95/1992)  governs the capital market, provides the \\\\nlegal framework for the Cairo and Alexandria  Stock Exchanges and sets the rules for \\\\nlisted businesses. The Capital Market Law is currently undergoing a process of revision \\\\nand intensive amendments. The proposed draft law provides mo re active support for \\\\nminority shareholders, presents a new concept for legal action, define s procedures to be \\\\nadopted in purchase tenders, and totally bans trading on insider information. It is \\\\nexpected that the Egyptian People’s Asse mbly will discuss the draft law in 2003. \\\\n                                                 \\\\n6 In addition to the Receipts of th e Holding Financial Investments Co.

This law \\\\nbecame effective after its executive regulations  were issued by the Minister of Foreign \\\\nTrade Decision No. 906 in November 2001. \\\\nAs for companies, there are three laws governing the establishment of a company \\\\nthat will be listed on the Stock Exchange:9 \\\\nThe Law on Joint Stock Companies, Limited by Shares Companies and Limited \\\\nLiability Companies (No. 159/1981)  regulates joint stock companies, limited-by-shares \\\\ncompanies and limited liability companies.10  By virtue of this law, the share capital of a \\\\njoint stock company is divided into shares of  equal value. The shareholders’ liability is \\\\nlimited to the value of the issued shares. As for the limited-by-shares companies, the \\\\nshare capital includes the portion that belongs to the joint partner(s) and shares of equal \\\\nvalue for subscription by one or more subscrib ers. The joint partners  are responsible for \\\\nthe company’s liabilities and their responsibil ity is unlimited. However, the subscriber’s \\\\nresponsibility is limited to th e value of his shares. A limite d liability company is not \\\\nallowed to issue tradable shares. \\\\nThe Investment Guarantees and Incentives Law (No. 8/1997)  was created to boost \\\\ninvestments in various economic sectors and specific industrial z ones through income tax \\\\nexemptions for 5, 10 or 20 years or permanently  in tax-free zones. This Investment Law \\\\nrefers to the Companies’ Law N o. 159/1981 in all other aspects. \\\\nThe Public Business Sector Law (No. 203/1991) cited 314 public sector \\\\ncompanies to be sold.11  These companies were established as joint stock companies and \\\\nthen became affiliated companies under 17 holding companies as of 1991. Once private ownership reaches 51 percent of the company’ s shares, it becomes subject to Law No. \\\\n159/1981. \\\\nEfforts are underway to draft and disc uss a unified law that would replace a \\\\nnumber of the current laws and dispersed provisions. It would ensure  that all businesses \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n9 In addition to Capital Market Law No. 95/1992, Chapter Three. \\\\n10 Amended by Laws No. 212/1994, 3/1998 and 159/1998. \\\\n11 190 companies were privatized from the beginning of the privatization program until June 30, 2002. \\\\n10 \\\\n--- Page 14 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n(capital corporate sector and individuals’ companies) in E gypt are adhering to a unified \\\\nmodernized regulatory system that facilitates investors’ dealings with the administrative \\\\nauthorities and enhances transparency.  \\\\nGovernmental and Quasi-Governmental Supervisory Agencies  \\\\nThe supervisory agencies that regulate, s upervise and monitor the capital market and \\\\nensure the proper applicati on of corporate governance fall into two categories: \\\\nGovernmental Agencies and Quasi-Govern mental (or self-regulatory) Agencies. \\\\nThe Capital Market Authority (CMA)   \\\\nCMA is a government agency subject to the supe rvision of the Minister  of Foreign Trade. \\\\nHowever, it is an independent agency. Its board  of directors is its supreme authority. Two \\\\nof its seven board members, namely, the chairman and the deputy chairman, are \\\\nappointed by a Presidential Decree for a period of three renewable years. The other board \\\\nmembers are appointed by a decree of the Pr ime Minister for a period of two renewable \\\\nyears. The Capital Market Authority is primarily funded by its revenues from accrued \\\\nfees. The salaries of the Authority’s employees  are high in comparison to the salaries of \\\\ntheir peers in the government sector. Foreign technical and financia l support enabled the \\\\nAuthority to hire skilled pr ofessionals and pay them high salaries. Nevertheless, their \\\\nsalaries are lower than those of employees in the private sector and in the Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria Stock Exchanges. The Capital Market Authority is responsible for the enforcement of the Capital Market Law a nd for supervising market development and \\\\nregulating, as well as mon itoring all its activities. \\\\nMoreover, the Capital Market Authority has the competence to impose \\\\nadministrative sanctions including warnings, writing off from the tables, suspending or \\\\ncanceling licenses,\\\\n12 canceling operations or bargains13 (even after settlement in case of \\\\nany illegal action or behavior), conducti ng inspection operations and suspending the \\\\n                                                 \\\\n12 The common sanction is to suspend the brokerag e license for a period not exceeding one month. \\\\n13 Immediate cancellation (before settlement) is the responsibility of the Chairman of the Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria Stock Exchanges.  \\\\n11 \\\\n--- Page 15 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ngeneral assembly’s decisions for a period of fift een days in the case of verified damage to \\\\nminority shareholders.14 \\\\nThe Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges \\\\nThe Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges (CASE), a quasi-self-regulatory authority by \\\\nvirtue of law, is managed by an elected board  of directors under the supervision of the \\\\nCapital Market Authority (CMA). The board  comprises eleven members: the Stock \\\\nExchanges\\\\' chairman who is appointed by th e Prime Minister, six members representing \\\\ntrading companies, two members representi ng banks, one member from the Central Bank \\\\nof Egypt and one member from the CMA. The Capital Market Authority has the right to \\\\nobject to the decisions issued by CASE’s board  of directors. CASE is responsible for \\\\nensuring commitment to listing rules, but has no  authority for investigation or inquiries. \\\\nCASE may impose sanctions that range from transferring a company from the formal to \\\\nthe non-formal table, suspending trading, or writing off the registration according to the \\\\nnature and type of infringement. \\\\nMisr Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository Company   \\\\nThis joint stock company was established ac cording to the provisions of the Capital \\\\nMarket Law No. 95/1992. CMA issued its approval on 21/8/1994 to establish the \\\\nCompany as a self-regulatory entity subject to CMA’s supe rvision and responsible for \\\\nenforcing the Central Depository Law No. 93/2000. Misr Clearing, Settlement and \\\\nCentral Depository Company comprises members from securities’ brokerage companies, depository trustees licensed by CMA, issu ers of securities, banks and financial \\\\ninstitutions willing to participate in the Company provided they practice brokerage or \\\\ndepository trustees\\\\' activities. \\\\nMisr Clearing, Settlement and Central De pository Company is the sole central \\\\nauthority in Egypt entrusted with CASE’s clea ring and settlement operations. It is also \\\\nresponsible for the application of the centr al depository system in Egypt including \\\\nverification of the central ow nership of the securities trad e in the Stock Exchange and \\\\ntransferring trading to book entries for easy ha ndling by shareholders. \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n14 The Authority may ask defaulters to increase their portion of the insurance fund of Stock Exchange \\\\noperations. \\\\n12 \\\\n--- Page 16 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nThe General Authority for Investment and the Capital Corporate Sector  \\\\nThe Capital Corporate Sector (formerly the Company’s Administration) supervises the \\\\nenforcement and application of the Compan ies Law No. 159/1981. This Sector is subject \\\\nto the General Authority for Investment a nd Free Zones (instead of the Ministry of \\\\nEconomy and Foreign Trade) under Deci sion No. 415/2001. The Sector has the \\\\ncompetence to reject applicati ons for the establishment of companies and to ratify the \\\\nirregular general assembly’s decisions to liq uidate a company. The General Authority for \\\\nInvestment supervises companies es tablished according to Law No. 8/1997. \\\\nThe Ministry of P ublic Business Sector \\\\nThis Ministry and in particular the hold ing companies are responsible for companies \\\\nestablished according to Law No. 203/1991. \\\\nPrivate Institutions  \\\\nIn addition to the governmental and quasi-gove rnmental supervisory bodies, two types of \\\\nprivate institutions operate in the market. The first type is the non-pr ofit or self-regulatory \\\\ninstitutions that help ensure  discipline in the capital market, and the second comprises \\\\nprofit-driven private institutions. \\\\nNon-Profit Private Institutions \\\\nThe Egyptian Capital Market Association  was established in 1996 as a professional \\\\nassociation comprising 250 member s representing most of the companies operating in the \\\\ncapital market.15  It is the main body for conveying the opinions of the workers in this \\\\nfield to the supervisory agencies for c onsideration while drafting capital market \\\\nregulations and laws. The Association orga nizes training courses for the employees, \\\\nconvenes seminars for raising public awareness of investment, and resolves disputes that \\\\nmay arise between its members or between them and other parties. \\\\nEgyptian Association for Investment Management was founded in 2001. The \\\\nAssociation comprises members from financ ial and investment establishments, banks, \\\\ninsurance companies and asset managers. Through training courses and workshops, it \\\\n                                                 \\\\n15 The draft Capital Market Law proposes to make membership of this Association mandatory and to \\\\nconvert it to a self-regulatory organization.  \\\\n13 \\\\n--- Page 17 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nacts to enhance the members’ efficiency and improve the quality of the services they \\\\nprovide investors. Further, it issues a professional certificat e to portfolio managers to \\\\nensure performance quality and qualification. \\\\nThe Egyptian Accountants and Auditors Association  was founded in 1946 with \\\\nthe main objective of promoting the professi onal and technical levels of accounting and \\\\nauditing nationally and internationally. In addi tion to its essential role in the study of \\\\ndraft economic laws on topics such as taxes and investment and pr eparing accounting and \\\\nauditing standards according to decisions of the Minister of Foreign Trade, the \\\\nAssociation participates in st udies and research on economic  laws, taxes and investment. \\\\nThose who have university degrees and post-gr aduate degrees in accountancy fields and \\\\nhave served for several years in accredited accountancy offices are allowed to join the \\\\nmembership of the association provided they pass the examinations held by the Association.  \\\\nProfit-Driven Private Institutions  \\\\nThere are several profit-driven  practitioners competing at the capital market. They \\\\ninclude auditors, accountants, law c onsultants, credit-rating companies,\\\\n16 financial \\\\nanalysts and information dissemination companie s, securities brokerage firms, promoters, \\\\nunderwriters and asset management firms a nd law offices. To ensure the quality and \\\\naccuracy of financial disclosure, the Au thority approves a group of auditors.17 \\\\nNevertheless, Egypt’s Capital Market lacks ma rket makers who act to guarantee a regular \\\\nperformance of the market by buying or sel ling shares and thus preventing sharp and \\\\nunjustified declines or increases in prices.18  It is worth noting that a market maker may \\\\nalso be a brokerage company. \\\\n \\\\n                                                 \\\\n16 There are seven credit-rating companies in Egypt accredited by the Capital Market Authority. The \\\\nmajority of the accreditation committee must be from  one of the accredited in ternational credit-rating \\\\ninstitutions. To ensure impartiality, banks and auditors are not allowed as partners  in these companies.   \\\\n17 The Capital Market Authority keeps a list of 55 accredited auditors for investment funds. The Ministry of \\\\nFinance accredits the auditors of joint stock comp anies. The Central Accoun tancy Authority accredits \\\\nauditors for the public capital companies. As for bank s, the auditors are accredited by the Central Bank of \\\\nEgypt. For the Insurance companies,  they are accredited by the Insuranc e Supervisory Authority. The Real \\\\nEstate Authority will be responsible for accrediting the list of auditors for real estate finance companies.  \\\\n18 They sell shares when demand is higher than supply and buy shares when supply is higher than demand. \\\\n14 \\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nRegistration and Listing Requirements  \\\\nCompanies that issue shares must present the prospectus to the Capital Market Authority \\\\nfor revision and approval in order to guara ntee the companies’ compliance with the \\\\nconditions. As soon as the application is approved, a company may disseminate and \\\\ndistribute its issuance prospectus as the fi rst step in offering shares for public \\\\nsubscription. A summary of the prospectus  must be published in two daily morning \\\\nnewspapers in Arabic language  designating where the issuance prospectus is available. \\\\nRegistration and disclosure procedures of the Cairo and Alexandria Stock \\\\nExchanges were updated in order to ensu re the proper applic ation of corporate \\\\ngovernance principles. According to the ne w registration rules, as of August 2002, \\\\ncompanies are now registered in one of four  tables instead of three: Formal Table 1, \\\\nFormal Table 2, Informal Table 1 and Informal  Table 2. Formal Table 2 was added to list \\\\nsecurities issued by the state for public subscr iption, securities issu ed by public sector \\\\ncompanies subject to Law No. 97/1983, and the public business sector companies subject \\\\nto Law No. 203/1991, all of which were formerly listed in Formal Table 1. \\\\nThree criteria were added to the new regist ration rules to conform to international \\\\nstandards. They are: profita bility, number of shareholde rs, and the minimum level of \\\\ncompanies’ share capitals. These criteria  defined and differentiated between public \\\\nsubscription and private subscription for the first time in Egypt. A company’s securities \\\\nwill be considered a private subscription if  the number of shareholders through their \\\\ntrading process reaches 50 or more; and will be considered a public subscription if the \\\\nnumber of shareholders through their trad ing process reaches 100 or more. Thus, a \\\\ncompany will not have the choice of being register ed in a particular table, as was the case \\\\nbefore. Registration takes place according to the criteria available in every company.19  \\\\nThe new rules oblige companies to publis h their registration applications on the \\\\ninternet and the Stock Exchange daily bulletin to give those concerne d the right to object \\\\nto the Registration and Cancellation Committee within ten days from the publication \\\\n                                                 \\\\n19 Some practitioners say that some registration rules ar e difficult to adhere to such as the condition of \\\\nissuing financial statements every three months (it is suggested to be every six months) and obliging the \\\\nauditing committee of the company to present monthly auditors’ reports (it is suggested to make them \\\\nquarterly or biannually). \\\\n15 \\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ndate. From August 1, 2002, the Stock Exchange  started the adoption of a system for \\\\nregistering agents at the Stock Exchange to  make it easier for companies to complete \\\\ntheir registration procedures through them. According to the trading rules of the Stock \\\\nExchange, the CMA supervises the shares’ pr ice movement, which should be within a 5 \\\\npercent increase or decrease. But by virtue of the criteria issued by the Minister of \\\\nForeign Trade Decision No. 441 in July 2002, th ese price limitations were removed from \\\\nthe most active shares (which reached 14 shares in March 2003). Price limitations are \\\\nexpected to be lifted from all the remaining shares as well. There are no price limitations \\\\non bonds and the closing price is left for the market mechanisms except for the bonds \\\\nconvertible to shares, which are subject to current price limits.  \\\\nThe new rules gave companies with securiti es listed on the Stock Exchange tables \\\\na period of one year from 1/8/2002 to 31/7/2003 to adapt the registration position of their securities according to the ne w registration rules. Thirty-four companies harmonized their \\\\npositions as of 31/12/2002, i.e., 2.95 percen t of the total registered companies.\\\\n20 \\\\nOwnership Structure  \\\\nIn 2002, investment percentage reached 17 per cent for individuals (15 percent nationals \\\\nand 2 percent foreigners), 78 percent for en terprises (64 percent national and 14 percent \\\\nforeign) and 5 percent for investment funds (1 percent national and 4 percent foreign). \\\\nPensions and Insurance Funds invest a sma ll portion of their assets in shares only. \\\\nThe number of public businesses that were privatized and that publicly trade their \\\\nstock reached 190 in 2002. Most of them were sold  to an anchor investor or were sold to \\\\nthe majority through the Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, the state s till keeps a share of \\\\nmany of the privatized companies through holding companies, and is the principal shareholder of those companies. In such cases , the structure of the board of directors and \\\\nupper management is often identical to their structure before privatization. A decision \\\\nwas issued in March 2003 to sell the remaining portions in these companies to the private sector, which had a positive effect on thei r market trading value. The portion of the \\\\nemployee shareholders union in these companies ranges between 5 percent and 10 percent.  \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n20 All the changes in the rules of re gistration will be duly discussed. \\\\n16 \\\\n--- Page 20 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n1. Shareholders’ Rights  \\\\nThis section deals with the ex tent to which shareholders are protected through the legal \\\\nframework. It includes the right to transfer the ownership of their shares, to vote in the \\\\ngeneral assembly, to select board members, to obtain dividends from their shares, to \\\\nrevise the financial statements and the right to active participation in the general \\\\nassembly meetings. \\\\n1/1. Fundamental Rights \\\\nThere are no restrictions on tr ansferring the ownership of shares registered in the stock \\\\nexchange.21  On January 1, 2001 almost 62 percent of  all shares were material (share \\\\nwarrants). But book trading (without handling share warrant) expanded to reach 99.6 \\\\npercent of total Stock Exchange trading in 2002. The Central Depository and Registry \\\\nLaw obliged all the registered companies to register at Misr Clearing, Settlement and \\\\nCentral Depository Company. The total number of companies registered reached 870 in December 2002.\\\\n22  The remaining 278 companies registered at the Stock Exchange were \\\\nnot registered at the Central Depository. \\\\nClearing and settlement are made on the basis of cash-on-delivery in the sense \\\\nthat securities are delivered to the buyer against the payment of its value to the seller. If securities are deposited at Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository Company, \\\\nthe purchased securities are de livered to the buyer in the fo rm of book entries, i.e. they \\\\nare added to the buyer’s account  of securities at the depos itory company and at the \\\\nconcerned depository trustees at the same time  when their value is added to the settlement \\\\naccount of the selling broker.\\\\n23  It is worth mentioning that  settlements of operations \\\\nimplemented on active securities whose price re strictions on market trading were lifted \\\\nare made on the second day after trading (T +2). Settlements implemented on the other \\\\n                                                 \\\\n21 According to Article 63 of the Capital Market Executive Regulations No. 95/1992, the founders’ shares \\\\nare non-transferable for 2 years, whereas according to Article 45 of the Companies Law No. 159/1981 the \\\\nqualifying shares of the board members become transfer able as soon as a manager resigns or is dismissed \\\\nby the annual general assembly and the board of directors is acquitted. \\\\n22 Of these companies, 860 are re gistered at the Stock Exchange  and 10 are not registered.  \\\\n23 Depository trustees are responsible for the management and depositing the accounts of securities’ traders. \\\\nIn addition to Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central De pository Company, there are 16 banks that provide \\\\ndepository services. The five major banks in this field are: the National Bank of Egypt, Commercial \\\\nInternational Bank, Citibank, American Express and HSBC. \\\\n17 \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nsecurities in central deposito ry are made on the third day af ter trading (T+3). Settlements \\\\nimplemented on material share warrants are ma de on the fourth day af ter trading (T+4).  \\\\nBefore the Central Depository Law was i ssued, all the clearing and settlement \\\\noperations were made according to ISSA- 630 recommendations with the exception of \\\\nthree subjects: the effective payment system with geographical spread, securities lending \\\\nand borrowing, and the registration of all th e companies registered  at Misr Clearing, \\\\nSettlement and Central Depository Company. Th e latter was dealt with by the Central \\\\nDepository Law as mentioned earlier. The law also addressed the subject of securities \\\\nlending and borrowing and decided the neces sary means to ensure that Central \\\\nDepository members would meet their obligations regarding settlements in securities, including a system for lending securities to Central Depository members. However, the \\\\nregulations that organize the implementation of lending operations have yet to be issued. \\\\nThe Settlements Guarantee Fund was esta blished in January 2000 with capital \\\\nprovided by securities brokerage companies pro rata  the volume of th eir trading at the \\\\nStock Exchange. The Fund is run as a self-r egulatory organization under the supervision \\\\nof the Capital Market Authority. The Fund’s main function is to protect the investor \\\\nagainst non-commercial risks and to guarantee the implementation of  the financial and \\\\nsecurities settlement operations liabilities for trading operations at the Stock Exchange in \\\\ncase either party fails to fulfill its obligation to the other. \\\\nAs for the lack of a system of bank paym ents that are geographically widespread, \\\\nnegotiations are ongoing between the Central Bank of Egypt and Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central Depository Company to  allow the Company to discount and add \\\\non the Banks’ accounts at the Central Bank of Egypt according to the results of the securities’ trading operations. Presently, shar eholders can obtain the interest on their \\\\nprofits from 42 bank branches in 10 governorat es covering all the regions of Egypt from \\\\nCairo and Alexandria to the Delta and Upper E gypt, in addition to all of the branches of \\\\nthe Central Depository Company. According to the Law, profits have to be distributed \\\\nwithin 30 days from the issuance of the general assembly decision. Disbursement takes place either in cash, by cheques, bank transf ers or by personal delivery from the Central \\\\n18 \\\\n--- Page 22 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nDepository Company to the customer’s pre-determined address.24  The system is not \\\\nlimited to interest disbursement, but incl udes bonds yields, depreciation values, and \\\\nrepayments for the restructuring of issuing companies deposited at the Central Depository \\\\nCompany. \\\\n1/2. The General Assembly Meetings and Disclosure of Financial Statements \\\\nThe Companies’ Law No. 159/1981 stipulated th at the annual general assembly should be \\\\nconvened within three months from the end of the previous financial year. It also \\\\nstipulated that summaries of the financial st atements and the audito rs’ reports should be \\\\npublished in two daily newspapers or sent by registered mail to every shareholder at least \\\\n15 days before the date of the general assembly meeting. The  chairman of the board of \\\\ndirectors chairs the annual m eeting of the general assembly. The invitation to the meeting \\\\nmust include date, time and place of the meeti ng as well as the agenda, the annual report, \\\\nthe auditors report (if not published), and the board of directors’ re port. In addition to \\\\nnotifying the shareholders, thr ee other parties must be notified, namely the auditor, the \\\\nCapital Market Authority and the administ rative bodies to whic h the listed company \\\\nbelongs. \\\\nAs mentioned earlier, the Capital Market Authority has a superv isory role over all \\\\nthe companies registered at the Stock Mark et whether they are founded according to Law \\\\nNo. 8/1997 or Law No. 203/1991. In addition to  CMA’s supervisory role, companies \\\\nfounded according to Law No. 8 /1997 and Law No. 159/1981 are subject to the supervision of the General Authority for Investment; and companies founded according \\\\nto Law No. 203/1991 are subject to the supervision of the Ministry of  the Public Business \\\\nSector or rather, the holding company. \\\\nContrary to Law No. 159/1981, trading in  or transferring the ownership of \\\\nsecurities shall not cease during the conventi on of the general assembly of the company \\\\nthat issued the shares. However, trading in th e securities of an investor willing to attend \\\\nand vote in the general assembly shall ceas e so that he preserves his position as a \\\\nshareholder. But practically speaking, this is  difficult to implement. The legal quorum for \\\\nconvening the general assembly is three board  members at least (as mentioned in the \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n24 In the case that the shareholder belongs to one of the special categories such as widows or senior citizens.  \\\\n19 \\\\n--- Page 23 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ncompany’s statutes), the auditor and a number of the shareholders representing at least \\\\none-fourth of its share capita l. If this quorum is not reached, an invitation may be \\\\naddressed for a second meeting. No minimum quorum is required for the second meeting \\\\nunless the company’s statutes stipulate a higher percentage. \\\\nShareholders representing 5 percent of a company’s share capital may add items \\\\nto the agenda up to three days before the meeting. The Law does not stipulate whether the \\\\ncompany has to distribute the amended agenda publicly before convening its general assembly. It is also possible to discuss any urgent matters and vote on them without \\\\nhaving them listed in the agenda if the majority of the shareholders present at the meeting agree they are worthy of discussion. Sharehol ders may ask questions, and the board of \\\\ndirectors must answer them provided they  do not cause “any harm to the company’s \\\\ninterests or to public interest”. If the c oncerned parties consider  the answers to be \\\\ninsufficient, they may call the general assembly to make a decision on that subject. \\\\nShareholders who paid 50 percent or less of  the shares’ issue value are entitled to \\\\nall voting rights. However, the profits they may obtain are pro rata  their paid-in amounts. \\\\nVoting may be in person or by proxy, but  voting by proxy is subject to certain \\\\nrestrictions. If the principal is a natura l person, the representing person should be a \\\\nshareholder (this does not a pply to non-physical persons), who has a power of attorney \\\\nand is not a member of the board of directors.\\\\n25  A natural person is not allowed to \\\\nrepresent more than 10 percent of the total shares and 20 percent of the shares represented in the meeting (thi s does not apply on non-physical shareholders). Voting is \\\\nby secret ballot if it is concerning the el ection, dismissal or penalization of a board \\\\nmember or if the board chairman or sharehol ders who represent one-tenth of the capital \\\\nattending the meeting call for a secret ballot . The general assembly appoints two of the \\\\nattendees, in addition to the s ecretary of the session, to count the votes and supervise the \\\\nvoting and casting process. In the past, voting was not allowed by regular mail or by e-mail, but this option is now available for shareholders. However, it has yet to be applied.  \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n25 Board members are not allowed to vote in person or on behalf of one or more shareholders because it is \\\\nthe shareholders who call board of directors to question. \\\\n20 \\\\n--- Page 24 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nThe Central Depository Law differentiates between the register ed owner and the \\\\nbeneficiary owner. Executive regulations gi ve registered owners  the right to vote on \\\\nbehalf of all the beneficiary owners (block voting). The law also allows the registered \\\\nowner to fragment the votes of the benefici ary owners. This means that they can cast \\\\ndiffering votes on the same subject. \\\\nShareholders can get information on thei r voting rights on the different categories \\\\nof shares either from the company’s statutes, from the commercial registry at the Ministry \\\\nof Supplies and Internal Trade for a required fee,26 or from the Association of Capital \\\\nSector. Another source of information is  the company’s issuance prospectus and \\\\nbrokerage offices. In the past, it was not neces sary to disclose the capital structure or the \\\\nreal structure of ownership in the annual report. But new rules made it obligatory for \\\\nregistered companies to forward biannual reports to the Stock Ex change (on 31/12 and \\\\n30/6) that include th e shareholders’ structure. More over a company has to forward a \\\\nreport as soon as a radical change takes pl ace in the shareholders’ structure throughout \\\\nthe year. \\\\nShareholders have the right to review th e financial statements, which include the \\\\ncompany’s financial position, income statemen ts, cash flows, changes in equity and the \\\\nattached clarifications and th e auditors’ report for the past  three years. The information \\\\ncan be reviewed at the company’s headqua rters for two weeks before the general \\\\nassembly meeting, provided a signed applicati on for revision is filed. Article 15 of the \\\\nStock Exchange registration ru les concerning disclosure obliges registered companies to \\\\ndesignate a person responsible for relations with  the shareholders to act as a liaison with \\\\nthe Stock Exchange and to answer the queri es of the shareholders and investors. \\\\nThe Companies Law No. 159/1981 gives shar eholders who own 5 percent of the \\\\nshare capital the right to call for the annual m eeting of the general assembly if the board \\\\nof directors does not call for it. Extraordinar y meetings of the general assembly may be \\\\nheld according to the request by shareholders owning 10 percent of th e capital shares or \\\\nby the board of directors. The legal quorum of the first meet ing must be 50 percent of the \\\\nshare capital unless the statutes stipulate a higher percentage. If the quorum is not \\\\n                                                 \\\\n26 LE 20 per copy. \\\\n21 \\\\n--- Page 25 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nreached, the quorum for the second meeting will be 25 percent of the share capital. The \\\\nauditor and the Associations of Capital S ector may also call for an ordinary or \\\\nextraordinary meeting of  the general assembly. \\\\n \\\\n2. Equitable Treatment of Shareholders  \\\\nEquitable treatment of shareholders refers to  equality among of the holders of shares in \\\\neach category, the right to defend their legal rights, to vote in the general assembly on \\\\nfundamental decisions, to be protected against any suspicious mergers or acquisitions and \\\\ninsider-trading, and their right  to be informed of all the transactions of the board \\\\nmembers and the executive managers. \\\\n2/1. Voting Rights \\\\nEgypt’s legal framework allows for multi-shar es categories provided the shareholders of \\\\nany category are treated similarly and equall y. There are two main categories of shares: \\\\ncommon shares and preferen ce (or preferred) shares.27 Common shares are either \\\\nregistered (sometimes called “nominal”) or to-the-holder.28  The holder shares should not \\\\nexceed 25 percent of the total shares and they  must be paid in full. Owners of holder \\\\nshares may take part in the annual meeting of the general assembly if their shares are \\\\ndeposited at the bank, the issuer company or  at Misr Clearing, Settlement and Central \\\\nDepository Company, but they do not have the right to vote. \\\\nOwners of preferred shares enjoy three advantages. Firs t, advantages related to \\\\nvoting: they may have multi-votes accordi ng to the statutes of  the issuer company.29  \\\\nSecond, the owners of “profit-co llecting” preferred shares ha ve the right to be paid a \\\\ndefined and fixed percentage of the revenue  before any other profits are distributed. \\\\nThird, priority upon liquidation and priority in  share capital increase.  The share capital \\\\nmay be increased through preference shares if a company’s statutes stipulated such a \\\\n                                                 \\\\n27 Most of the shares traded in Egypt are ordinary shares. Ordinary shares represented 99.6 percent of the \\\\ntotal market capital on 31/1/2003, whereas traded pr eference shares represented 0.4 percent. Cairo and \\\\nAlexandria Stock Exchanges, Monthly Bulletin , January 2003. \\\\n28 Holder or bearer shares were in troduced by the Capital Market Law No. 95/1992 (Article No. 1 of the \\\\nExecutive Regulations), but the holder does not have the right to vote. \\\\n29 In most cases, the voting rights comprise a maximum of  two votes per share. But there is no legal limit. \\\\n22 \\\\n--- Page 26 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nclause upon incorporation and if it is approved at an extraordinary meeting of the general \\\\nassembly according to a suggestion by the board of directors and the auditors, who must \\\\ndeclare their justification for this action.30 \\\\nEvery shareholder has the right to submit a complaint to the concerned \\\\nadministrative agency regarding any violation of the law. A shareholder who attends the \\\\nannual meeting of the general assembly and re gisters his objection to a certain decision in \\\\nthe minutes of the meeting has the right to file  a lawsuit before the court within one year \\\\nfrom the date of the meeting. Article No. 76 of the Companies Law No. 159/1981 \\\\nstipulates that all the decisions issued in fa vor of a specific categor y of shareholders or \\\\ncausing any damage or harm to them or decisi ons offering special bene fits or advantages \\\\nto the board of directors sha ll be nullified. Furthermore, shareholders who represent 5 \\\\npercent or more of the share capital are entitled to submit a complaint to the board of directors of the Capital Market Authority. CM A shall have the right and the authority to \\\\ncancel the decisions of the annual meeting of th e general assembly if they are deemed to \\\\nbe in favor of a specific category of sharehol ders or may cause any damage or harm to \\\\nthem or offer unfair benefits or advantag es for the board of directors or others. \\\\nShareholders who represent 10 percent or more of the share capital are entitled to ask the \\\\nCapital Market Authority or  the Capital Corporate Sect or to conduct surveys and \\\\ninspections.  \\\\nIn the past, the Capital Market Law allowed traders at the Stock Exchange to \\\\nresort to mandatory arbitration. But because legal actions are costly and time-consuming, \\\\nthe High Constitutional Court ruled in Janua ry 2002 that mandatory arbitration is \\\\nunconstitutional. However, optional arbitra tion is still allowed. The Stock Exchange \\\\nrecently announced a project to  establish, in collaboration wi th the Cairo International \\\\nArbitration Center and the CMA, a new cente r for dispute settlemen t and arbitration for \\\\nthe securities market by the e nd of the current year (2003). The new system aims to \\\\naccelerate the resolution of disputes occurring between the stock exchange traders and the \\\\nsecurities’ companies without resorting to th e judicial system, which is often a lengthy \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n30 Companies whose statutes did not stipulate upon incorporation the possibility to increase share capital \\\\nthrough preference shares ar e not allowed to issue these shares. Howe ver, there are attempts to amend the \\\\nlaw so as to allow this process by a special majority. \\\\n23 \\\\n--- Page 27 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nprocess, especially since there are no judici al circuits specializing in capital market \\\\nlawsuits or in economic disputes.31  The proposed draft Capital Market Law allows CMA \\\\nto file collective lawsuits on behalf of the shareholders. Th is is what is called a class \\\\naction lawsuit.32 \\\\n2/2. Participation in the Comp any’s Fundamental Decisions  \\\\nVoting must be conducted with a two-thirds majority for decisions related to granting \\\\nadvantages to the present shareholders before  increasing the share capital, failure to apply \\\\nthe priority rights if stated in the compa ny’s statutes, or adding new items to the \\\\ncompany’s objectives. Similarly, two-thirds of  the shareholders in the same category \\\\nmust agree in order to make any changes to their voting rights. Voti ng shall be conducted \\\\nwith a 75 percent majority for decisions relate d to increasing or decreasing share capital, \\\\nchanging the original purpos e of the company, prolonging or shortening the duration of \\\\nthe company or deciding to dissolve or merg e the company. If the attained losses reach \\\\n50 percent of the issued share capital, the board  of directors must call for an extraordinary \\\\nmeeting of the general assembly to consid er whether to dissolv e or continue the \\\\ncompany. \\\\n2/3. Follow-Up and Supervision of Companies  \\\\nAny person willing to buy shares  that will raise his ownership to 10 percent or more of \\\\nthe share capital has to send prior notice to  the company by registered mail two weeks \\\\nbefore the completion of the purchase. Within  one week from receiving this notification, \\\\nthe company must inform the shareholders w ho own at least 1 percen t of the company or \\\\npublish such information in two widespread newspapers. The allowed ownership limit for \\\\nboard members or employees is 5 percent of  the share capital. This process must be \\\\ncompleted within one month fr om the notification date. If  the percentage exceeds 20 \\\\npercent for shareholders before or after the planned ownership (15 percent for the \\\\ndirectors and employees), an offer to purchas e the required portion of the share capital \\\\nmust be issued to all shareholders. The offer may be for all the shares or just for a portion of the shares. The offered price must be at least equal to the aver age closing price during \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n31 Researches are currently being conducted to establish specialized legal circuits. \\\\n32 The Draft Law allows the filing of collective lawsuits on behalf of the shareholders. \\\\n24 \\\\n--- Page 28 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nthe month that preceded the notification. The purchase offer remains valid for a period of \\\\ntwo weeks, and may be extended. If the offere d shares are more than required, the buyer \\\\nmust buy from all the shareholders pro rata  their shares. Recentl y, CMA has started to \\\\nrefuse purchasing offers that may cause th e buyer to own the majo rity of the company \\\\nunless the offer is for 100 percent of the shares . This is to avoid one shareholder having \\\\ncontrol over the management of the comp any while the minority shareholders are \\\\nnegatively affected. \\\\n2/4. Insider Trading and Self-Dealing  \\\\nEgypt’s legal framework does not deal with the subject of in sider trading and self-dealing \\\\nin a definite manner. Article No. 64 of th e Capital Market Law No. 95/1992 deals with \\\\nany person who discloses secrets under his co ntrol by virtue of hi s duties or job, whose \\\\nwife or children benefit from disclosing intern al information related to his job, who uses \\\\nimportant, false misleading or incorrect information, or who omits any important \\\\ninformation from the reports he makes to th e extent that affects the results of those \\\\nreports. Despite its presence, this provision is insufficient. In order to secure the \\\\nefficiency of supervision on trading in insi der information, it is suggested that each of \\\\nthese cases be properly defined. \\\\nThe new rules oblige companies to observe certain disclosure procedures \\\\napplicable to those who deal with the companies’ information and internal secrets. The \\\\nprocedures address the following issues. \\\\n- Persons who obtain the information in a secret manner should not trade in the securities of the concerned company un til the information becomes publicized. The \\\\ncompany must provide the Stock Exchange with any information in this respect, \\\\nespecially concerning the persons w ho have access to such information. \\\\n- If the company is willing to announce information in its general assembly that may cause a tangible change in the value of the listed shares, the company must take the necessary procedures to convey such info rmation to CMA and the Stock Exchange. \\\\nThis ensures that such information will not be made available to shareholders before \\\\n25 \\\\n--- Page 29 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nit is published on the trading monitors, whic h occurs at the same time it is announced \\\\nto the shareholders attending the meeting. \\\\n- The board members, officials and persons who have access to internal information \\\\nagree that they will not buy or sell the co mpany’s securities according to internal \\\\ninformation not disclosed to the public. \\\\n- The adopted internal supervisory procedures prevent the board members, managers \\\\nand employees from trading the company’s sh ares fifteen days before and three days \\\\nafter issuing or publishing any essential data or information that may cause an \\\\nimportant change in the co mpany’s securities price. \\\\n- The adopted internal supervisory procedures oblige the company’s board members, officials and persons who have access to the internal information to inform the exchange market and CMA of any opera tions they conduct to buy or sell the \\\\ncompany\\\\'s securities at leas t 24 hours before the implementation of such operations.  \\\\nCMA created a database for all the indivi duals who have access to the companies’ \\\\nsecrets and other sources of information. Cadr es working in the trading supervisory field \\\\nat the Stock Exchange and CMA were trained in the USA in the most recent techniques \\\\nin this field. Guidelines were al so prepared for methods of action. \\\\nThe Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges are responsible for immediate \\\\nsupervision during trading, while CMA is responsible for subsequent supervision after trading. A group of professional supervisors work  at CASE both in Cairo and Alexandria. \\\\nSome of them work with the brokers in the compartment. Others observe market activity \\\\nto discover any insider trad ing or self-dealing. The Supervision Department inspects \\\\ntrading through code numbers for investors.  It  is also possible to inspect them by their \\\\nnames through the Information Department or  through brokers’ ledge rs and orders. CMA \\\\nand CASE are connected electr onically online. In case of manipulation in prices, the \\\\nchairman of CASE or CMA suspends the o ffer/tender prices and cancels the operations. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n26 \\\\n--- Page 30 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n2/5. Deals with Related Parties  \\\\nEgypt’s accounting standards require that board members and managers disclose the \\\\ntrading, bargains and other businesses conduc ted with related part ies, including board \\\\nmembers or managers, regardless of whether such operations were already made or are \\\\ngoing to be made. Disclosures must be writte n with the clarifications attached to the \\\\nfinancial statements. A board member who has any conflict of interest must inform the \\\\nboard of directors, record it in the minutes of the meeti ng, and abstain from voting. The \\\\nboard of directors must inform the annual ge neral assembly of any operations with the \\\\nrelated parties. \\\\nThe new registration rules defined the nature of dealings with related parties that \\\\nthe companies have to inform the Stock Exchange about, including: \\\\n\\\\x83 A summary of the important contracts of the company or of any related \\\\ncompanies during the two years that pr eceded the registration application. The \\\\nsummary should include the amounts paid to or from the issuing company or its affiliates. \\\\n\\\\x83 The organizational structure of the company that shows whether it is a holding or an affiliate company. \\\\n\\\\x83 The capital structure including the percenta ge of the shareholders who own more \\\\nthan 5 percent of the holding company and its affiliates. \\\\n\\\\x83 Statement of the transactions between  the issuing company and any of the \\\\nshareholders in the company or in its affiliates. \\\\n 3. Stakeholders’ Role in Corporate Governance\\\\n \\\\nThis section analyzes to what  extent Egypt’s legal framewor k allows stakeholders to own \\\\na portion of the shares, to be informed of the company’s essentia l operations, and how it \\\\nprotects their interests. Stakeholders in clude the bondholders, workers, banks, suppliers \\\\nand customers. \\\\n \\\\n27 \\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n3/1. Respect of Legal Rights  \\\\nThe Companies’ Law No. 159/1981 gives the workers the right to 10 percent of the \\\\ncompany’s distributed profits with a maximu m limit of their salary for one year. This \\\\nright can only be exercised in the case of profit distribution. The Law also gives the \\\\nworkers the right to participate in the manage ment of the company. Its statutes decide the \\\\nmost suitable methods and rules to be applied in this concern, with  the exception of the \\\\npublic business sector. Presently, there are no representatives for workers on companies\\\\' \\\\nboards of directors. Instead, companies esta blish “workers committees” or other similar \\\\nbodies to handle matters for the workers including wage and other compensations. One of the board members is responsible for liaison with this committee. On the other hand, the \\\\nCapital Market Law No. 95/1992 gives bondholders  special protection. For example, they \\\\nhave the right to form bondholders’ associations  and elect a legal representative to work \\\\non their behalf and attend the annual m eetings of the general assembly. These \\\\nassociations issue recommendations for the annual general assembly or the board of \\\\ndirectors, but do not have the right to vote in the general assembly meetings. \\\\n3/2. Compensation for Rights Violation \\\\nStakeholders’ rights are prot ected by contracts and by certa in laws such as the Labor \\\\nLaw, the Environment Law or the Bankruptcy System.\\\\n33  Stakeholders have the right to \\\\nresort to legal procedures for compensation for any violations of their rights.34  \\\\n3/3. Mechanisms to Promote Stakeholders’ Participation  Workers may establish federations or associat ions with the purpose of owning shares or \\\\ndistributing profits. The workers shareholders associations must be registered with CMA \\\\nand must have written statutes. Only the wo rkers of the company are entitled to its \\\\nmembership. The board of direct ors runs the association and its  ultimate authority lies in \\\\nthe general assembly. The Workers\\\\' shareholde rs associations in privatized companies \\\\nown 5 percent of the share capita l on behalf of the workers. The association is usually \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n33 The organization of bankruptcy rules is, at the pr esent time, subject to the Commerce Law. But the new \\\\nCapital Market Law will handle defaulting companies’ problems in a manner similar to that of the Federal \\\\nBankruptcy Code, Title 11 of the US Code. Chapter 7: Liquidation, and Chapter 11: Reorganization.  \\\\n34 In the case of a merger, stakeholders are protect ed by a condition that does not allow prejudice of \\\\ncreditors’ rights, and that stakeholders have priority in case of a company\\\\'s liquidation.  \\\\n28 \\\\n--- Page 32 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ngiven a seat on the board of di rectors when it owns 10 percent of the share capital if the \\\\nstatutes specify that shareholders ar e represented on the board of directors pro rata  the \\\\nshares they own. It is also allowed to re-buy the sold shares. In this case, the shares are \\\\ncalled treasury stocks35 and the re-buying process is called share buyback. Sometimes \\\\nthese shares are distributed to workers. Treasury stocks may be kept for no more than one \\\\nyear, then they are either resold or the general assembly is called for a meeting to make a decision on reducing the share capital by the nom inal value of the treasury stocks. Some \\\\ncompanies have share ownership programs for their employees and executive managers,\\\\n36 \\\\nbut there is no definite system  for such programs to date. \\\\n3/4. Access to Information \\\\nWorkers, in their capacity as shareholders, have the right to gain access to the same \\\\ninformation as other shareholders. The bondhol ders’ group has the ri ght to review the \\\\nfinancial statements and send a representative to  participate in the annual meetings of the \\\\ngeneral assembly. \\\\n \\\\n4. Disclosure and Transparency  \\\\nThis section deals with all aspects of disc losure and transparency in relation to the \\\\ncompany’s activities and th e role of the auditor. \\\\n4/1. Disclosure of Important Information  \\\\nEvery company registered at the Stock Exchan ge is obliged to disclose its financial \\\\nposition and its operational performance to the CMA and CASE. This disclosure takes \\\\nplace either annually or quarterly. The informati on that must be disclosed in the financial \\\\nposition and the income statements include s the changes in equities, cash flows, \\\\ncomplementary clarifications of  the statements, the report of the board of directors, and \\\\nthe report of the external auditor. \\\\n                                                 \\\\n35 Treasury stocks have two characteristics: 1) they do not have the right to vote; 2) they do not have the \\\\nright to profits. The company buys its shares if the ma rket price is unfair. So, it buys some of its traded \\\\nshares and distributes the profits to fewer shareholde rs in order to improve th e company’s market value. \\\\n36 Such programs are not included in the company’s statutes.  \\\\n29 \\\\n--- Page 33 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nCMA examines the financial statements to ensure the company has met the \\\\nrequirements and the extent to which the statements conform to Egyptian accounting \\\\nstandards. CMA may ask a company to disclo se and publish more items than it has in \\\\nprevious years.  If a company fails to m eet this condition, CMA publishes its comments \\\\non the company’s financial statements at the cost of that company. Companies are also \\\\nobliged to publish complete summaries of  their annual and biannual reports in two \\\\nwidespread daily newspapers; at least one of  them must be in Arabic. Companies must \\\\nprepare their financial statements according to the Egyptian accounting standards, which \\\\nare issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and are mostly in harmony with international \\\\naccounting standards. In this context, it is worth mentioning that in  2002 the Ministry of \\\\nForeign Trade issued (by Ministerial Decree No. 345) three new standards in harmony with international accounting standards and other standards are st ill under preparation. \\\\nAccording to said Ministerial Decree, companies have to apply the international accounting standards if no parallel  Egyptian standard is issued.\\\\n37 \\\\nCompanies also have to immediately disclose to CMA and CASE all the \\\\nimportant events that may affect the comp any’s financial positi on or its operational \\\\nturnover. As soon as the Stock Exchange is  informed, it must publish the information \\\\nimmediately on the monitors and inform the brokerage companies. The Disclosure \\\\nDepartment of the Stock Exchange supervises  the companies to ensure they make the \\\\nrequired disclosures. According to the new registration rules, the Stock Exchange may \\\\nimpose penalties and sanctions on companie s that deliberately disclose wrong or \\\\nmisleading information in their financial statem ents. The penalty for failing to conform to \\\\ndisclosure rules is elimination from registra tion tables. The new registration rules impose \\\\nfinancial penalties on companies that do not  observe the rules of transparency and \\\\nperiodical disclosure of material inform ation, financial statements and non-financial \\\\ninformation.  \\\\nThe following are the major points of the new disclosure rules: \\\\n                                                 \\\\n37 This is with the exception of leasing standards pr epared according to the Egyptian requirements, which \\\\ndo not group the leased assets with the assets of th e lease-holder, but consider them assets owned by the \\\\nlessor that appear in his balance sheets.  \\\\n30 \\\\n--- Page 34 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n\\\\x83 Companies shall inform the Stock Exchange  of any material events that affect \\\\ntheir activities or financial position, or a ffect the trading of its shares. Companies \\\\nmust report these events immediately and no tify the Stock Exchange at a time that \\\\nallows it to publish these events on the m onitors immediately or before the first \\\\nsubsequent trading session afte r the occurrence of these events as well as in the \\\\nfirst bulletin issued after th e occurrence of the events. This Article stipulates what \\\\na company must do if important or em ergency events occur during formal \\\\nholidays. The Article gives examples of such events. \\\\n\\\\x83 Important events are published in co ordination with the company and the \\\\nmanagement of the Stock Exchange. Publishing does not take pl ace during trading \\\\nhours unless the information must be pub lished immediately. In such a case, \\\\ntrading on the company’s securities will be suspended for a period to be decided \\\\nby the Stock Exchange Chairman, pr ovided it does not exceed one hour. \\\\n\\\\x83 The company must take the necessary precau tions to secure the confidentiality of \\\\nthe financial information and to prevent any deliberate or accide ntal leak before it \\\\nis announced to traders. \\\\n4/2. The Auditor \\\\nCompanies have to submit their annual and biannual financial statements following the \\\\nrevision and approval of the auditor. Quarterly financial statements are to be submitted \\\\ntogether with a limited examination report. In this context, it is wo rth noting that the new \\\\nregistration rules necessitate that the co mpany’s upper management, executive manager \\\\nand financial manager must verify that there is no unrecorded information that may affect \\\\nthe company’s financial position and that ther e are no lawsuits filed against the company \\\\nthat may require building-up a dditional allocations other than those mentioned in the \\\\nfinancial statements. \\\\nThe annual general assembly has the manda te and the authority to appoint the \\\\nauditors and to determine their compensation. It is not necessary to disclose the fees for consultative services at the annual general assembly meeting. However, the new rules of \\\\nautonomy necessitate that audi tors should not provide any co nsultation to a company for \\\\nwhich they examine and audit its accounts unl ess they obtain a license from the Auditing \\\\n31 \\\\n--- Page 35 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nCommittee. An auditor should not be one of  the company’s founders, board members, \\\\nemployees or related by any other means to th e company or its board of directors. There \\\\nis nothing to prevent an a uditor from being a shareholde r of the company he audits, \\\\nwhich is against the principles of autonomy. An auditor is not allo wed to become a board \\\\nmember or an employee of the company until th ree years after the expi ry date of his work \\\\nas its auditor.  \\\\nAn auditor has the right to examine all documents, data and the other necessary \\\\ninformation and to ask for the support of the board of directors to help him realize his \\\\nmission. If the auditor can not get all the in formation he deems necessary to accomplish \\\\nhis goal, he may forward a report to the boa rd of directors or the general assembly \\\\ndenoting that he will not e xpress his opinion due to insuffi cient information. The auditor \\\\nmust inform the general assembly to which he is also going to subm it his auditor’s report. \\\\nAny shareholder may submit a request for the dismissal of the auditor up to ten \\\\ndays before the date of the general asse mbly’s meeting after providing, in writing, his \\\\njustifications for the dismissal. The auditor ha s the right to reply to this motion in a letter \\\\ndefending the actions that were subject to cri ticism and consideration. The auditor is held \\\\nresponsible for any mistakes or distortion of f acts, and is responsible  for indemnifying the \\\\ncompany and/or the shareholders for any dama ge resulting thereof. The new registration \\\\nrules require companies to form internal  auditing committees and to disclose the \\\\ncommittee\\\\'s activities to the financial community. All the members of these committees \\\\nmust be non-executive board members. These committees may also comprise non-board members and experts in order to supervise th e internal auditing activities and to appoint \\\\nthe auditor, determine his f ees and discuss his reports. \\\\nThe first step any potential auditor must take is to register  his name at the \\\\nMinistry of Finance. After eight years of serv ice and gaining experience, he or she will be \\\\nentitled to audit the accounts of any company without having to sit for an examination. \\\\nThis is with the exception of the Egyptian Accountants and the A uditors Association \\\\n(1,350 active members in a country compri sing about 18,000 registered accountants) \\\\nwhose membership is only granted after passing high standard examinations.  \\\\n32 \\\\n--- Page 36 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nIt is worth noting that the Egyptian A ccountants and Auditors Association in \\\\ncooperation with the Ministry of Finan ce, the Commercial Syndicate, CMA and the \\\\nCentral Accountancy Authority prepared a draft law (an amendment of the current Law \\\\nNo. 133/1951) to regulate practicing the acc ounting and auditing professions in Egypt. \\\\nThe draft law was discussed at the State Council and was referred to the government in preparation for forwarding it to the People’ s Assembly for approval. The draft law \\\\ncomprises articles that deal with the strict  supervision of auditors’ performances and \\\\npreconditions for registration at the account ants’ tables, especially sitting for the \\\\nexaminations as stipulated by the Law. It also provides for the establishment of a Higher Council for Supervision and Monito ring of the Accounting Profession.\\\\n38  The Council \\\\nwill form a sub-committee responsible for mon itoring and supervising the performance of \\\\nthe auditors of companies registered in the Stock Exchange and for inspection and \\\\nimposing penalties on those who do not conf orm to the Egyptian and international \\\\naccounting standards. \\\\n4/3. Disclosing Ownership of the Majority of Shares \\\\nAccording to the Central Depository Law, the settlement company must keep a registry \\\\nof detailed information on the beneficiary owne rs, which are obtained from the registered \\\\nowners. Nobody is allowed access to this registry  except the issuers of securities and the \\\\nauthorized bodies within the limit that concerns each of them. The Law requires \\\\nregistered owners to disclose details of the beneficiary owners. The companies as well as \\\\nMisr Clearing, Settlement and Central De pository Company keep registries for \\\\nshareholders and update them continuously; however these registries do not denote the \\\\nownership of the ultimate beneficiary. Companie s must present these registries to their \\\\nannual general assemblies. Shareholders have  the right to review  the minutes of the \\\\ngeneral assembly meeting, which include, as annexes, the names of all the registered \\\\nowners and the number of shares owned by each of them. Such information must also be \\\\n                                                 \\\\n38 The majority of the council would be comprised of non -accountants. It will be chaired by the Minister of \\\\nFinance, with members from the CMA, the Insura nce Supervisory Authority, the General Investment \\\\nAuthority, the Central Accountancy Authority and a re presentative from each of the Egyptian Accountants \\\\nand Auditors Association, the Free Professions Pr actitioners’ Branch  and a number of accounting and \\\\nauditing experts. \\\\n33 \\\\n--- Page 37 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nmade available to the administrative bodies (t he Investment Authority, the Associations \\\\nof Capital Sector and the holding companies).  \\\\nRecently, CASE has started to demand th at the most active companies – which \\\\namount to about 30 companies and form CA SE’s index – disclose their ownership \\\\nstructure of 5 percent or more.39  Under all circumstances, this  practice is not considered \\\\nmandatory either by virtue of the law or the current regulations.40  The new Capital \\\\nMarket Law as well as the new registration rules aim to promote ownership disclosure. \\\\n4/4. Disclosure for Board Members and Executive Directors \\\\nThe board members\\\\' degree of disclosure, wh ich must be presented to the company’s \\\\ngeneral assembly, is decided by the company’ s statutes. For example, the names of the \\\\nboard members and their remuneration are disc losed to the annual general assembly, but \\\\nsuch information is not published in the a nnual report. The board members\\\\' remuneration \\\\nincludes their fees and travel  allowances, and their annual portion of the profits which \\\\nshould not exceed 10 percent of the net income  (after discounting 5 percent as statutory \\\\nreserve and 5 percent to the paid in capital as  divisible profits). Th e executive directors’ \\\\ncompensation is not disclosed. CMA asks the companies to present annual lists of names \\\\nand nationalities of their board members and key officials and managers as well as any \\\\ninformation or relevant details regarding them. CMA must be informed immediately of \\\\nany changes that take place on such lists. \\\\nBoard members have to disclose any conf licts of interest and should not vote on \\\\nboard decisions connected with such conflicts. The board conveys such information to \\\\nthe annual general assembly. Board members mu st obtain special authorizations from the \\\\nannual general assembly in order to trade fo r their own interests in the same business \\\\nsector or to be a party to any contract presented to the board for approval. They should \\\\nalso not enter into contracts with other companies and take fees from them if their \\\\ncolleagues are board members, managers or executives in these companies. \\\\n \\\\n                                                 \\\\n39 This is important when the Law requires certain limits of ownership such as airline companies. \\\\n40 The Capital Market Law requires disclosu re of 10 percent of the share capital. \\\\n34 \\\\n--- Page 38 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n4/5. Disclosure of Other Information \\\\nA relatively low number of companies publis h formal annual reports in addition to the \\\\nrequirements stipulated by the Companie s Law No. 159/1981 and the Capital Market \\\\nLaw No. 95/1992. According to the latter, a co mpany that issues debt instruments for \\\\namounts exceeding the net value of its assets must get an annual rating from the rating \\\\ninstitutions accredited by CMA. \\\\n \\\\n5. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors  \\\\nThis section deals with the structure of th e board of directors, the selection of its \\\\nmembers, its main functions and its supervisory role ove r the executive management. \\\\n5/1. Structure and Legal Responsibilities \\\\nThe board of directors’ membership consists  of an odd number with a minimum of three \\\\nmembers. There are no rules that govern the board structure from executive or non-\\\\nexecutive managers. So far the concept of the “independent board member” is not clearly \\\\napplied in most of the companies in Egypt . The board chairman is often also the \\\\nmanaging director. The board member responsi ble for administration is sometimes called \\\\nthe managing director or the executive director; and the board  decides his/her \\\\nremuneration. Board members must be shar eholders or repres entatives of the \\\\nparticipating companies with the excepti on of two members (as a maximum) who are \\\\nchosen because they are “experts in the fiel d”. The board elects its chairperson and his \\\\ndeputy sometimes, and has the right to change them any time. The board holds its meetings at the request of its chairperson or two-thirds of its members. The board \\\\nmeeting is considered valid if the number of attendees is not less than half of its members \\\\nplus one, provided the number of attendees  is not less than three board members. \\\\n5/2. Selection of Board Members \\\\nThe annual general assembly el ects board members for a period of three renewable years \\\\nand decides their remuneration. Election condi tions include the owne rship of a minimum \\\\nnumber of shares as indicated  in the company’s statutes (with the exception of the two \\\\n35 \\\\n--- Page 39 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nexperts). These shares will be kept as qualification shares until the expiry of the board’s \\\\nterm and the ratification of the last annual report by the annual general assembly.41 \\\\nA worker can not be appointed as a board member if his period of service at the \\\\ncompany is less than 2 years. There should be  no more than three executive managers on \\\\nthe board of directors. Board members should agree in writing on th e appointment of the \\\\nexecutive managers and their CVs should be sent to the general assembly provided they contain lists of the companies at which they  worked during the previous three years. \\\\nManagers may serve on a maximum of two boards, but managing directors should only \\\\nserve on one board with the exception of the ma nager who owns at least 10 percent of the \\\\ncompany’s share capital. Board members lose their qualification immediately if they declare bankruptcy or commit a criminal action or a serious crime such as robbery, \\\\nbreach of trust or forgery. Shareholders may dismiss or fire managers. The law penalizes managers who commit crimes of bribery or forgery, give misleading information, divide \\\\nillusionary profits or enter into self-dealings. Penalties include imprisonment and/or fines according to the gravity of the infringement. \\\\n5/3. Main Responsibilities \\\\nThe board of directors is the high authority that governs the company or enterprise. It is \\\\nresponsible for supervising the implementati on of the company’s objectives as decided \\\\nby its general assembly. The board is responsib le to the shareholders  as deputy for them. \\\\nConsequently, all the provisions of proxy in the Egyptian Civil Law are applicable to the \\\\nboard of directors. The board is also legally responsible for any distortion or forgery of \\\\nthe company’s information. For example, ever y board member is subject to imprisonment \\\\nfor not less than 2 years and a fine ra nging between LE 2,000 and LE 10,000 if profits are \\\\ndivided in a manner different from the pr ovisions of the Companies’ Law No. 159/1981 \\\\nor the company’s statutes. The functions of the board of directors include: inviting the \\\\nshareholders to meet, investing the company’s funds, requesting loans, appointing executive managers and submitting financial st atements and board reports to the annual \\\\ngeneral assembly meeting. Th e board report also includes a summary of activities and \\\\n                                                \\\\n \\\\n41 It is worth noting that Egypt allows an artificial person to be a board member, which is why there are \\\\noperational difficulties. Only France and Belgium also  allow an artificial person as a board member. \\\\n36 \\\\n--- Page 40 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nproposed plans for the coming year. The board of  directors may also allow an increase in \\\\nthe company’s share capital w ithin the authorized limits without the need for a special \\\\ndecision from the shareholders or from the general assembly. \\\\n5/4. Independent Supervision \\\\nBy virtue of the Egyptian laws, the annual ge neral assembly, the board of directors, the \\\\ninternal and external auditors and the governmental agen cies all supervise and monitor \\\\nthe company’s management. The annual general assembly is considered the top authority \\\\nand all its decisions are binding. But in practice, shareholders do not play an active role in \\\\nsupervising and monitoring management. In most companies, there is no actual \\\\nseparation between the board of directors and the executive management. It is a one-tier \\\\nstructure of management. The board of dir ectors does not include independent members, \\\\nnor does it form ad hoc committees to consider assigned subjects.42  Some companies do \\\\nnot appoint an internal auditor. Even in comp anies with internal auditors, their authority \\\\nis very limited. CMA and the administrative supervisory bodies, upon the request of the \\\\nshareholders (and within their authoritie s and mandate), supervise the company’s \\\\nmanagement through inspection activities. Representatives of the Investment Authority, the Associations of Capital Sector and CMA attend the general assembly’s meetings to \\\\nguarantee the integrity of the administrative pr ocedures and make sure that the issued \\\\ndecisions are not biased toward a group of sh areholders at the expense of the remaining \\\\nshareholders. If there is d oubt about the board’s actions, the concerned agencies issue \\\\norders for examination and inspection. The Central Accounting Authority audits the \\\\naccounts of companies with state owne rship of more than 25 percent. \\\\n Conclusion: Main Results and Recommendations\\\\n \\\\nDevelopments at the Cairo a nd Alexandria Stock Exchanges indicate that the period from \\\\nSeptember 2001 to March 2003 witnessed consid erable progress in corporate governance \\\\nstandards in Egypt, with s ubsequent improvement of the overall assessment of these \\\\nstandards (Table 1). Standards that conf orm completely or considerably to the \\\\n                                                 \\\\n42 With the exception of the execu tive committees which are responsible for the day-to-day operations. \\\\n37 \\\\n--- Page 41 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\ninternational corporate governance standards rose from 40 to 45 standards. The number \\\\nof standards unobserved in Egypt dropped from 8 to only 3 standards. \\\\n \\\\nTable 1: Development of the Overall Assessment of Corporate Governance Rules in Egypt, \\\\nSeptember 2001 to March 2003 \\\\n Completely \\\\nObserved Considerably \\\\nObserved Slightly Observed Not Observed \\\\nSeptember 2001 Assessment* 14 26 6 2 \\\\nMarch 2003 Assessment ** 24 21 2 1 \\\\nSources:  * Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade (2001). \\\\n ** As calculated by researchers.  \\\\nThe assessment showed that progress was achieved in the five principles of \\\\ncorporate governance, but the degree of impr ovement differed from one principle to \\\\nanother. According to this assessment, the order of the five corporate governance \\\\nprinciples in Egypt based on th eir degree of conformity to in ternational standards is as \\\\nfollows: the stakeholders’ role in corpor ate governance, equitable treatment of \\\\nshareholders, shareholders’ rights, disclosure and transparency, and responsibilities of the \\\\nboard of directors.43 \\\\nThe following are the most important pr ocedures undertaken from September \\\\n2001 to March 2003 that had a tangible eff ect in improving the overall assessment. \\\\n\\\\x83 Shareholders’ Rights \\\\no It became possible to vote by ordina ry mail or electronic mail at the \\\\ngeneral assembly meetings. \\\\no Development of registration rules to conform to the international \\\\nprinciples of corporate governance. \\\\no Provision of safe methods for regi stration, settlement and profit \\\\ndistribution, and the establishment of the Settlements Guarantee Fund. \\\\no The establishment of dis pute resolution center.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n                                                 \\\\n43 Annex No. 2 contains a detailed assessment of the five principles and a comparison with the assessment \\\\nof October 2001. \\\\n38 \\\\n--- Page 42 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n\\\\x83 Equitable Treatment of Shareholders \\\\no CMA’s right to suspend the decision s of a general assembly that are \\\\nbiased to a specific category of shareholders. \\\\no Allowing the registered owner to vote on behalf of the beneficiary owner \\\\neither totally or severally.  \\\\no The issuance of the new disclosure rule s that allow for strict supervision of \\\\ninsider trading. \\\\no The organization of acquisition opera tions and purchase offers and \\\\nallowing class action lawsuits. \\\\n\\\\x83 The Stakeholders’ Role in Corporate Governance \\\\no The establishment of shar eholders’ groups and allo wing representatives of \\\\nthe groups to attend the ge neral assembly meetings.  \\\\no Licenses to form the workers\\\\' shareholders associations.  \\\\n\\\\x83 Disclosure and Transparency \\\\no The development of disclosure require ments of financial and non-financial \\\\nstatements, and their electronic dissemination.  \\\\no Draft Law for practicing the accounti ng and auditing profession in Egypt.  \\\\no The obligation to appoint a person responsible for the shareholders’ \\\\naffairs.  \\\\n\\\\x83 Responsibilities of the Board of Directors \\\\no Obliging the companies to appoint in dependent or non-executive members \\\\nto the board of directors.  \\\\no Obliging the companies to form auditing committees from non-executive board members.  \\\\no Obliging the companies to disclose th e ownership structure, the principal \\\\nshareholders and the report of the board of directors. \\\\n39 \\\\n--- Page 43 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nIn spite of this remarkable progress, there is still a need to complete the legal \\\\nframework for corporate governance, and a great need to enhance the application of \\\\ncorporate governance principles. The major fiel ds that still need additional efforts are: \\\\nprotecting the minority share holders’ rights; ensuring the board’s performance of its \\\\nfunctions and the strict supervision of its actions; em phasizing disclosure of the \\\\nownership structure details; completing the legal framework; and increasing the \\\\nefficiency of the supervisory bodies. The fo llowing are some detailed suggestions for \\\\nimproving these issues. \\\\n\\\\x83 Enhance the instruments for protecting th e minority shareholders by, for example, \\\\nestablishing a mechanism to protect their rights similar to the shareholders’ group, \\\\nstarting the implementation of class ac tions and amending the rules governing \\\\npurchase offers to ensure more eff ectiveness in protecting the minority \\\\nshareholders. The executive regulations s hould stipulate that if the ownership of \\\\nany shareholder reaches 40 percent of the share capital, he has to purchase the \\\\nremaining shares. Those who own bearer  shares should be allowed to vote \\\\nprovided they pay the complete value of th e shares in order to enjoy voting rights. \\\\n\\\\x83 Establish rules that facilitate the perfor mance of the board by obliging companies \\\\nto appoint non-executive or independent boa rd members, to activate the role of \\\\nthe auditing committees and to appoint an independent auditor. Moreover, \\\\ncompanies should publicize their implementa tion of the principles of corporate \\\\ngovernance after the approval of CMA and the Stock Exchange. There is no doubt \\\\nthat the establishment of a training ce nter for managers and informing board \\\\nmembers and executive managers of joint stock companies of their corporate \\\\ngovernance duties will help improve the board’s  activities especia lly in relation to \\\\nits supervision of the executive management.  \\\\n\\\\x83 Secure the thorough and accurate disclosu re of material and non-material \\\\ninformation so that it includes the register ed owner and the beneficiary owners in \\\\nthe equity statements and the cross-holdi ng structure. Doing this would show the \\\\nessential interests of every shareholde r, the final owner of any share, the \\\\nattendance percentage of board members in  order to make the shareholder aware \\\\n40 \\\\n--- Page 44 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nof the time a member gives to managing the company, and finally it would \\\\nsupport the automatic disse mination of disclosure. \\\\n\\\\x83 Complete the legal framework that secu res the proper applic ation of corporate \\\\ngovernance. This includes issuing the ame nded Capital Market Law, the unified \\\\nCorporate Law, the draft law on pr acticing the accounting and auditing \\\\nprofession, the Antitrust Law, Compet ition Law and the Monopoly Prevention \\\\nLaw. In addition, it is necessary to acceler ate and start the activ ities of the dispute \\\\nsettlement and arbitration center and to es tablish specialized j udicial circuits for \\\\ncases concerning the capital market. \\\\n\\\\x83 Raising the efficiency of the supervis ory, monitoring and judicial bodies, and \\\\nestablishing specialized circuits for courts concerned with capital market lawsuits, and improving the skills of the employees ar e basic elements for strict supervision \\\\nof the capital market and for promoting corporate governance. \\\\nIn conclusion, we cannot overemphasize the importance of increasing public \\\\nawareness and the culture of corporate govern ance among traders. Equally important is \\\\nmaking the self-regulatory organizations and co mpanies that issue securities aware of the \\\\nvital role activating corporate governan ce plays in the growth and sustainable \\\\ndevelopment of companies. \\\\n \\\\n41 \\\\n--- Page 45 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n42  \\\\n \\\\n           \\\\nAnnexes  \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 46 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\nAnnex No. 1: Development of Stock Exchange Activity from January 1992 to December 2002 \\\\n \\\\n 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 \\\\nAnnual trading value (LE million)            \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 3.714 2.749 12.140 22.942 87.692 202.824 185.006 328.510 417.446 246.580 258.69 \\\\n Non-listed shares and bonds 225.3 293.7 1343.2 1555.2 2198.4 3937.4 4863.4 6235.1 7749.1 7016.4 8371.0 \\\\nAverage monthly trading value (LE \\\\nmillion)             \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 30.9 22.9 101.2 191.2 730.8 1690.2 1541.7 2737.6 3778.7 2054.8 2150.6 \\\\n Non-listed shares and bonds 18.8 24.5 111.9 129.6 183.2 328.1 405.3 519.6 645.8 584.7 698.4 \\\\nListed and trade shares and bonds (million)            \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 207 137 293 437 1.705 2.867 4.403 8.411 9.515 11.838 7.072 \\\\n Non listed shares and bonds 8.9 4.0 30.5 28.5 37.2 85.8 130.5 233.0 79.0 76.0 196.9 \\\\nNo. of operations            \\\\n Listed shares and bonds 11648 11184 51862 260964 2279521 1142510 672649 892291 1276216 1142410 739631 \\\\n Non-listed shares and bonds 855 750 42880 208651 36843 82841 14564 12909 10154 5521 94055 \\\\nNo. of companies listed and traded during \\\\nthe year 239 264 300 352 354 416 551 663 659 634 574 \\\\nAverage of companies with traded \\\\nsecurities during the month 78 84 91 113 129 168 218 243 232 218 210 \\\\nNo. of listed companies at the end of the \\\\nyear 656 674 700 746 646 650 861 1.033 1.076 1.110 1.150 \\\\nNo. of listed shares at the end of the year \\\\n(million) 405.7 424.0 451.0 1116.7 1387.9 1854.2 3354 4393 4672.8 5473.2 5605.7 \\\\nNominal share capital for listed companies (LE million) 8098 8890 8051 11052 13673 18291 33836 47077 74638 83020 92030 \\\\nMarket share capital for listed companies \\\\n(LE million) 10.845 12.807 14.480 27.420 48.086 70.873 83.140 112.331 119.778 111.333 122.014 \\\\nMarket share capital / nominal share \\\\ncapital 1.3 1.4 1.8 2.5 3.5 3.9 3.0 3.1 2.0 2.0 2.0 \\\\n \\\\nSource : CMA’s Information Center.  \\\\n43 \\\\n--- Page 47 ---\\\\nECES WP82/ Fawzy/ August 2003 \\\\n44  \\\\nAnnex No. 2: Summary of the Development of Corporate Governance Criteria in Egypt from September 2001* to March 2002**  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nCriteria \\\\n No. of \\\\nCriteria for \\\\nEach \\\\nPrinciple  Assessment \\\\nCompletely \\\\nObserved Considerably \\\\nObserved Slightly Observed Not Observed \\\\n2001 2003 2001 2003 2001 2003 2001 2003 \\\\n1.

Competition also contributes to \\\\nincentivizing innovation and cost reductions, \\\\nwhich in turn shall bene/f_it the national economy, \\\\nand will achieve optimal economic eﬃciency.\\\\nIn this context, Law No. 3 of 2005 on Competition \\\\nProtection and Prevention of Monopolistic \\\\nPractices (\\\"Egyptian Competition Law\\\" or \\\"ECL\\\") \\\\nwas promulgated to ensure the freedom of \\\\ncompetition and achieve economic eﬃciency as \\\\nwell as competitive neutrality. ECL also states the \\\\nestablishment of the Egyptian Competition \\\\nAuthority (the “Egyptian Competition Authority” \\\\nor “ECA”). ECA is an independent body established \\\\nin 2006, to monitor markets and detect violations \\\\nto ECL. ECA’s role is to ensure free competition in \\\\nmarkets and prevent anticompetitive practices in \\\\na manner that ensures producer and consumer \\\\nwelfare, while strengthening the eﬃciency of the \\\\nnational economy.\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nECA emphasizes on creating and developing awareness of the principles of free competition, as well as \\\\ncreating a clear understanding of the provisions and rules stipulated by ECL. The dissemination and \\\\npromotion of awareness of ECL’s provisions and the competition culture are optimal ways to promote and \\\\nadvocate competition policies. For this reason, ECA has published this Compliance Toolkit, with the aim of \\\\nspreading competition culture and raising awareness on the bene/f_its of complying with ECL. This Toolkit \\\\naims at enhancing compliance of all undertakings engaged in any economic activity according to the \\\\nprovisions of ECL, by guiding them to avoid anticompetitive practices and to design their own legal \\\\ncompliance programs.Promoting\\\\nCompetitionBetter\\\\nPrices \\\\nHigher\\\\nQualityConsumer\\\\nWelfare\\\\n Economic\\\\nWelfare\\\\nfor ProducersEconomic\\\\nEﬃciency\\\\nStrengthening\\\\nNational\\\\nEconomy\\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n3Who are the persons subject to\\\\nECL provisions?\\\\nArticle 2(a) ECL identi/f_ies the persons subject to ECL as: “Natural and juristic persons, economic entities, \\\\nunions, /f_inancial associations and consortiums, groups of persons notwithstanding their means of \\\\nincorporation, and related parties. ” In general, all natural and juristic persons that are engaged in economic \\\\nactivities are subject to ECL, this includes:\\\\nArticle 5 of ECL states: “The provisions of this Law shall apply to acts committed abroad should these acts \\\\nresult in the prevention, restriction or harm of the freedom of competition in Egypt and which constitute \\\\ncrimes under this Law” . ECL is applicable to practices committed by persons outside Egypt if such practices \\\\nrestrict competition within the Egyptian market. \\\\nAll types of companies, such as shareholders \\\\ncompanies, joint liability companies, limited \\\\npartnership companies, joint stock companies \\\\nwith shares and limited liability companies, as \\\\nwell as holding and aﬃliated companies.\\\\nAll companies notwithstanding their methods \\\\nof incorporation, /f_inancing, nationalities, \\\\nheadquarters location, or the main location of \\\\ntheir businesses.\\\\nTrade associations in which the aforementioned \\\\ncompanies participate.\\\\nNatural persons engaging in any economic \\\\nactivity, such as various liberal professions.\\\\nAll unions and syndicates.  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n4\\\\nDISSEMINATING\\\\nCOMPETITION CUL TURE\\\\nDETECT ANTI-COMPETITIVE\\\\nPRACTICES\\\\nRESPECTABLE\\\\nREPUTATION\\\\nAVOID COURT DECISIONS\\\\nAND FINANCIAL PENAL TIES\\\\nPROMOTING INVESTMENTWhat are\\\\nthe bene/f_its of complying with ECL?\\\\nDisseminating competition culture \\\\nwill encourage a greater number of \\\\nconcerned parties, such as \\\\ngovernment agencies, the business \\\\ncommunity and other stakeholders, \\\\nto avoid issuing decisions that do not \\\\nfollow competition policies or avoid \\\\nengaging in any anticompetitive  \\\\npractices. \\\\nPersons that are aware of ECL’s \\\\nprovisions would not engage in \\\\nprohibited anti-competitve practices. \\\\nHence, avoiding court decisions \\\\nimposing /f_inancial penalties for \\\\ninfringing ECL.\\\\nReducing barriers to entry and \\\\nensuring competitive neutrality, \\\\nsupports and encourages foreign and \\\\nlocal investors to enter and expand in \\\\nthe maket.\\\\nCompliance with ECL provisions \\\\neﬀectively leads to improving the \\\\npersons respectable reputation while \\\\nincreasing the competitiveness index \\\\nand compliance with ECL.\\\\nDisseminating awareness of ECL assists ECA in \\\\ndetecting various anticompetitive practices. \\\\nThis leads to safeguarding diﬀerent markets \\\\nand supporting a free market policy based on \\\\nsupply and demand. \\\\n\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\n5Practices prohibited by ECL are considered \\\\noﬀences punishable by criminal penalties. ECA \\\\nChairperson, upon approval of the majority of \\\\nthe Board members, may request the initiation \\\\nof criminal proceedings, pursuant to the \\\\nprovisions of Article 21 of ECL, which states: \\\\n“The criminal lawsuit or any procedure taken \\\\ntherein shall not be initiated, in relation to acts \\\\nviolating the provisions of this Law, unless a \\\\nwritten request of the Chairperson of the \\\\nAuthority is submitted upon the consent of the \\\\nmajority of the of its Board members. ” . \\\\nEconomic courts have the jurisdiction for \\\\nimposing penalties in relation to ECL oﬀences. Article 25 of ECL states that such a penalty is \\\\npersonal, as the person responsible for the \\\\nactual management of the juristic person shall \\\\nbe subject to the penalties stipulated for the \\\\nacts committed in violation of the provisions of \\\\nECL. The juristic person shall be jointly liable for \\\\npaying the /f_inancial penalties and \\\\ncompensation ruled by the court, if the breach \\\\nhas been committed by one of its employees \\\\nacting in the name of or on behalf of the juristic \\\\nperson.\\\\nIt is worth noting that ECA can settle \\\\nconcerning any infringements in accordance \\\\nto the provisions of Article 21 ECL. This shall be, \\\\nafter the approval of the majority of the Board \\\\nmembers and before a /f_inal ruling is issued by \\\\nthe relevant court. The settlement shall also be \\\\nconsidered a waiver of the request to initiate a \\\\ncriminal case, and results in the lapse of the \\\\ncriminal case. I\\\\nI: What are the anticompetitive\\\\npractices according to ECL?\\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\n6Anticompetitive practices as per ECL \\\\nare as follows:\\\\nArticle Article7\\\\n19Horizontal Agreements Vertical agreements\\\\nArticle Article\\\\nAbuse of Dominant Position Failure to notify\\\\nEconomic\\\\nConcentrations to ECA6\\\\n8\\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\nHorizontal agreements - also known as cartels - \\\\nare agreements between (current or potential) \\\\ncompetitors in the same relevant market, \\\\nincluding, but not limited to, agreements on \\\\n/f_ixing prices; allocating geographic areas, \\\\ncustomers, quantities; limiting product \\\\navailability;  or bid-rigging.\\\\nHorizontal agreements are among the most \\\\nharmful competition oﬀences. Competitors \\\\nshould make their decisions individually \\\\nwithout any form of coordination or \\\\nagreement between one another. This is in line \\\\nwith the principles of a free market economy, \\\\nwhich assume that markets function based on \\\\nsupply and demand mechanisms without the \\\\nin/f_luence of any other entities.Accordingly, these practices are considered per \\\\nse, or by object violations; which by their \\\\nnature cause restriction of competition. This \\\\nmeans that it is not necessary to prove the \\\\nexecution of the agreement or its \\\\nanti-competitive eﬀect.  Such agreements lead \\\\nto increased prices and loss of incentive for \\\\ncompanies to reduce costs or innovate, \\\\nreducing social and consumer welfare and \\\\nleading to distribution ineﬃciency.\\\\n7Horizontal Agreements: \\\\nArticle 6 para.1 of ECL\\\\nHorizontal and\\\\nVertical Relationships1\\\\nHorizontal Relationship\\\\nSupplier\\\\nService ProviderSupplierVertical Relationship\\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\n8Article 6 para.1 ECL explicitly prohibits competitors from entering into anti-competitive horizontal \\\\nagreements. It also outlines the types of agreements which are prohibited for competitors. \\\\nArticle 6 states: “Agreements or contracts between competing persons, in any relevant market, are \\\\nprohibited, if they cause any of the following:Article 6: Horizontal Agreements \\\\na) Increase, decrease or /f_ix prices \\\\nof relevant products\\\\nc) Coordinating with regard to \\\\nproceeding or refraining from \\\\nparticipating in tenders, auctions, \\\\nnegotiations and other calls for \\\\nprocurement.d) Restricting processes of \\\\nmanufacturing, production, \\\\ndistribution, or marketing of \\\\nproducts. This includes \\\\nrestricting product type or \\\\nvolume or limiting the \\\\navailability thereof. ”b) Divide product markets or \\\\nallocate based on geographical \\\\nareas, distribution centers, type of \\\\ncustomers, type of goods, market \\\\nshares, seasons or periods of time. \\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\nHorizontal agreements have been de/f_ined by \\\\nthe Egyptian courts as “the concurrence of wills \\\\nof two or more persons who are considered by \\\\nlaw to be competing persons on any act \\\\nrelated to their economic activity, with the \\\\nintention of restricting or limiting competition \\\\nin the market in which they operate, whether \\\\nthe agreement is written or verbal, or whether \\\\nit is based on an active or passive act. ”\\\\nAgreements in the context of ECL do not \\\\nnecessarily have to be contracts that create \\\\nlegal eﬀects and obligations. Horizontal \\\\nagreements can take many forms such as \\\\ngentlemen\\\\'s agreement or contracts.\\\\nAgreements violating Article 6 do not necessarily \\\\nhave to be explicit and clear agreements on \\\\nincreasing, decreasing or /f_ixing prices, restricting \\\\ndistribution or production, dividing markets, or \\\\nbid-rigging. It is suﬃcient that the agreement is \\\\nlikely to cause any of the mentioned eﬀects \\\\nbased on the content of the agreement and its \\\\ncircumstances.

The exchange of sensitive information is a type of \\\\nagreement between competitors that may signi/f_icantly restrict competition and, \\\\nconsequently, may constitute a violation to Article 6 ECL. \\\\nTherefore, competitors should be careful when exchanging information to avoid \\\\ninfringing Article (6) ECL.\\\\n12\\\\n--- Page 17 ---\\\\n13Article (22) of ECL stipulates that violations of Article 6 shall be punished by: “a /f_ine of not less than two \\\\npercent of the gross revenues of the product subject matter of the violation, and not exceeding twelve \\\\npercent of the aforementioned gross revenues, within the violation period. In case of the inability of \\\\ncalculating the aforementioned revenues, the penalty shall be a /f_ine of not less than /f_ive hundred \\\\nthousand Egyptian Pounds, and not exceeding /f_ive hundred million Egyptian Pounds.\\\\nThe minimum and maximum limits of the /f_ine shall be doubled, in case of recidivism for violating the \\\\nprovisions of any of the Articles 6, 7, 8 of this Law, and in case of failure to comply with the decisions \\\\nadopted by the Authority in accordance with Article 20 of this Law\\\" .\\\\nExample of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Articles 6(a) and 6(d) ECL\\\\nExample of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Article 6(c) ECL\\\\nECA received a request from the Minister of \\\\nTrade and Industry to study whether there are \\\\nany agreements or anticompetitive practices \\\\nin the cement sector in Egypt.\\\\nDuring the study period (which starts at the \\\\ndate of the entry into force of ECL on 16 May \\\\n2005), the study conducted by ECA concluded \\\\nthat the cement production companies \\\\nagreed to increase prices in violation of \\\\nArticle 6(a) ECL. ECA also detected a violation \\\\nof Article 6(d) ECL, as these companies agreed \\\\nto restrict marketing in the relevant market by \\\\nallocating market shares in the Egyptian \\\\nmarket.\\\\nIn addition, the Nasr City First Misdemeanors \\\\nCourt ruled that all the companies were \\\\npunished with a /f_ine of EGP 200 million.ECA initiated a study on the public procurement \\\\nmarket for medical supplies of cardiothoracic \\\\nsurgery. ECA received information regarding \\\\nthe suspected coordination between several \\\\nbidders in this market in violation of Article 6 \\\\nECL. \\\\nECA conducted dawn raids on the premises of \\\\nrelevant companies under investigation, and \\\\ngathered data and documents from the \\\\nrelevant authorities and other sources. Based on \\\\nthe legal and economic analysis of all the infor-\\\\nmation and data gathered throughout the \\\\ninvestigation, ECA detected that the companies \\\\nhad coordinated to submit identical price oﬀers. \\\\nAiming to take advantage of Article 68 of the \\\\nExecutive Regulations of Public procurement \\\\nLaw No. 89 of 1998, which allows for awarding \\\\nthe bidders who have submitted identical oﬀers \\\\nthe entire volume of products to be equally \\\\nshared amongst them.\\\\nTherefore, ECA’s Board of Directors concluded \\\\nthat there had been a violation of Article 6(c) \\\\nECL and referred the matter to the public prose-\\\\ncution. The Economic Court issued a ruling \\\\nwhereby it imposed a /f_ine of EGP 500 million to \\\\nbe paid by the companies. What is the penalty\\\\nforviolating Article 6?\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\n14\\\\nAn example of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Article 6(d)\\\\nAn example of an agreement in\\\\nviolation of Articles 6(b) and 6(d)ECA received a complaint against two Pharma-\\\\nceutical companies, alleging that the compa-\\\\nnies had agreed to bundle two separate prod-\\\\nucts. The agreement was that two medications \\\\nwhich they both produce for the treatment of \\\\nHepatitis C Virus, namely Daclatasvir and \\\\nSofosbuvir, should only be sold together as a \\\\nbundle. This agreement would force Egyptian \\\\npatients to buy speci/f_ic medications and \\\\nwould restrict the competitiveness of compa-\\\\nnies producing only Sofosbuvir. \\\\nECA’s Board of Directors decided that the two \\\\ncompanies had violated Article 6(d) ECL for \\\\ntheir agreement to restrict the distribution of \\\\nSofosbuvir and Daclatasvir by agreeing to \\\\nbundle them together. The Board also ordered \\\\nboth companies to individually set the prices \\\\nof their products and take the marketing \\\\ndecisions without coordination or exchanging \\\\nof con/f_idential and sensitive information with \\\\nany of their competitors.\\\\nThe two companies submitted a request to \\\\nsettle with ECA before initiating the criminal \\\\nproceedings. ECA accepted the settlement \\\\nrequest and the payment of the prescribed \\\\nsettlement amount pursuant to the provisions \\\\nof Article 21(a) ECL.ECA initiated an investigation following the \\\\nsudden exit of an online delivery company \\\\nfrom the Egyptian market. Raising the possibil-\\\\nity of the occurrence of an anticompetitive \\\\npractice in violation of ECL.\\\\nBased on the investigation, ECA established \\\\nthat the company’s exit from the Egyptian \\\\nmarket resulted from a market allocation \\\\nhorizontal agreement made in one of the Euro-\\\\npean countries between the two parent com-\\\\npanies of the two largest online delivery com-\\\\npanies in the Egyptian market in violation of \\\\nArticle 6 ECL. Market allocation on a geograph-\\\\nical basis between competitors is one of the \\\\nmost harmful anticompetitive practices, as it \\\\nfalls out of natural competition that gives \\\\nconsumers the freedom of choice between \\\\nproducts and ensures competitive prices and \\\\nbetter quality.\\\\nAccordingly, ECA Board of Directors issued its \\\\ndecision that the two parent companies had \\\\ninfringed Articles 6(b) and 6(d) ECL. ECA \\\\nordered the companies to immediately cease \\\\nthe implementation of the anticompetitive \\\\nagreement, to restore the situation to what it \\\\nwas before the conclusion of these agree-\\\\nments, and for the company that had exited \\\\nthe Egyptian market to re-operate. The two \\\\ncompanies have complied with ECA\\\\'s decision.\\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\n15In order to avoid the penalties of horizontal agreements, competitors must make decisions individually. \\\\nThis is in alignment with principles of free market economy that assumes that competition among \\\\nundertakings should be based only on supply and demand mechanisms, without any in/f_luence from third \\\\nparties.  \\\\nHow to comply with\\\\nthe provisions of Article 6 ECL? \\\\n1.Regarding the independence\\\\nof decision-making,\\\\nundertakings should:\\\\nMake decisions independently with regard to \\\\npricing, production and sales strategies, and \\\\nanything related to customers or suppliers.\\\\nAvoid coordination with competitors on \\\\nallocating markets, customers, or products.\\\\nAvoid coordination with competitors on \\\\nrestricting manufacturing, production, distri-\\\\nbution, or marketing of products, or restricting \\\\nthe type or size of products or limiting their \\\\navailability\\\\n2.

RPM is one of the vertical agreements \\\\nthat may harm competition, because it \\\\nrestricts intra-brand competition. It may also \\\\nresult in the coordination of prices among \\\\ndistributors (who are considered competitors) \\\\nespecially when setting minimum or /f_ixed \\\\nprices. Resale price maintenance\\\\nExclusive distribution agreements occur \\\\nwhen a supplier agrees with a distributor to \\\\nsell the suppliers products exclusively, or \\\\nagrees with the distributor to work exclusively \\\\nwith the supplier in certain geographic areas, \\\\ndistribution centers, customers; seasons or \\\\nperiods.Exclusive distribution agreementsThe most favored nation clauses (MFN \\\\nclauses) are anticompetitive vertical \\\\nagreements where one party cannot provide \\\\nproducts at prices better than those oﬀered \\\\nby the other party. For example, a distributor \\\\nmay require a supplier not to sell products at \\\\na better price to other distributors, which will \\\\nlead to the distributors\\\\' inability to provide \\\\nthe product at better prices; hence reducing \\\\ncompetition and raising prices for consumers.Most Favored Nation Clauses\\\\nSingle branding occurs when a supplier \\\\nagrees with a distributer to buy and distribute \\\\ntheir product exclusively. Single Branding\\\\n26\\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\n27Active sales occur when a distributor in a \\\\ndesignated geographical area seeks to attract \\\\nconsumers located in another geographical \\\\narea in an explicit and direct manner. For \\\\nexample, this is accomplished through \\\\nadvertisements or solicited discounts. \\\\nGenerally, the restriction of active sales is not \\\\na violation of Article 7 ECL.Restricting active sales\\\\nPassive sales, or unsolicited sales, mean that a \\\\ndistributor in a designated geographical area \\\\nful/f_ills orders from consumers in other \\\\ngeographical areas without seeking to attract \\\\nthem in an explicit and direct manner. Online \\\\nsales are a form of passive sales. Generally, the \\\\nrestriction of passive sales is a violation of \\\\nArticle 7 ECL, as it limits the consumer’s \\\\nfreedom of choice between the best products \\\\nat the best prices.\\\\nArticle 22 of ECL stipulates that violations of Articles 7 shall be punished by: “a /f_ine of not less than one \\\\npercent of the gross revenues of the product subject matter of the violation, and not exceeding ten \\\\npercent of the aforementioned revenues, within the violation period. In case of the inability of calculat-\\\\ning the aforementioned revenues, the penalty shall be a /f_ine of not less than one hundred thousand \\\\nEgyptian Pounds, and not exceeding three hundred million Egyptian Pounds.\\\\nThe minimum and maximum limits of the /f_ine shall be doubled, in case of recidivism for violating the \\\\nprovisions of any of the Articles 6, 7, 8 of this Law, and in case of failure to comply with the decisions \\\\nadopted by the Authority in accordance with Article 20 of this Law. ”What is the penalty for violating Article 7 ECL?Restricting passive sales\\\\nECA received a complaint alleging that a photography studio is the sole and exclusive studio that can \\\\nprovide photography and video recording services for wedding events in luxury hotels in Alexandria \\\\ngovernorate. \\\\nECA established that the relevant product market is the photography services of wedding events in \\\\n/f_ive-star hotels or in similar establishments, and that the geographic area is Alexandria governorate.\\\\nBased on the legal and economic analysis from the information and data obtained by ECA, it was found \\\\nthat the studio’s agreements with the hotels violates article 7 ECL. ECA concluded that such agreements \\\\nwould restrict the freedom of competition and restrict consumer choice in terms of the availability of \\\\nservices and their prices. In particular, during meetings conducted with market players, it was found that \\\\nsuch agreements negatively aﬀected market players in the relevant market and led to the exit of some \\\\nstudios from the market, as they were being unable to provide their services in the aforementioned \\\\nhotels because of the contractual conditions upon requiring changing the photographer.

The /f_irst step to follow is \\\\nresearching and identifying the areas of the \\\\ncompany’s business that are prone to \\\\nanticompetitive practices.\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed: \\\\n- Studying and reviewing the behavior of the company \\\\nand its employees □ Are there any employees \\\\nwho are likely to be in contact with competitors \\\\nas a result of the nature of their work? Are there \\\\nmechanisms that facilitate the process of \\\\nagreement with competitors (especially regarding \\\\nmeetings in trade associations or regarding \\\\npublic procurement)?\\\\n- Studying and reviewing any existing or potential \\\\nagreements □ Are there any agreements between \\\\nthe company and its competitors or suppliers \\\\nthat may violate the provisions of articles 6, 7, or \\\\n8 ECL?Risk Assessment Calculate your risks\\\\n51Second Step: Analyze the risks\\\\nAfter identifying the risks, the company must \\\\nanalyze and evaluate the risks and rank such \\\\nrisks according to the degree of harm to \\\\ncompetition in the market.\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed:\\\\n- Appoint an oﬃcer responsible for \\\\ncompliance to ECL provisions to analyze \\\\nthe risks and follow steps three and four. \\\\nThird Step: Manage the risks\\\\nOnce the risks have been assessed and ranked, \\\\nthe next step is to develop the necessary \\\\npolicies and procedures to mitigate and \\\\naddress them.\\\\n--- Page 56 ---\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed:\\\\n- Train and educate employees on the \\\\nimportance of compliance with ECL, as \\\\nwell as how to avoid any anticompetitive \\\\npractices (this should include, in particular, \\\\nemployees who attend meetings of trade \\\\nassociations, and those involved in public \\\\nprocurement).\\\\n- Take action to cease any practices that \\\\npotentially violate the provisions of ECL.Fourth Step: Monitor the risks\\\\nUndertakings should review the previous steps \\\\non a regular basis in order to ensure that no \\\\nnew risks arise that may harm competition.\\\\nFor instance, the following steps are \\\\nadvised to be followed:\\\\n- Reviewing the behavior of the company \\\\nand its employees on an annual basis\\\\n- Reviewing the existing or potential agree-\\\\nments on an annual basis\\\\n- Training employees repeatedly on an \\\\nannual basis, as well as training newly \\\\nhired employees.\\\\n52\\\\n--- Page 57 ---\\\\nFor inquiries\\\\nPlease contact ECA using the following \\\\nTel: 02-35351900\\\\nFax: 02-35370436\\\\nE-mail: info@eca.org.eg\\\\nAddress: B19, Smart Village, Kilo 28 Alex Desert Road\\\\nFor more information on ECA and for more publications, please \\\\nvisit ECA’s website\\\\n http://www.eca.org.eg\\\\n--- Page 58 ---\\\\nT: (202) 3535 1900     F: (202) 3537 0436\\\\nwww.eca.org.egBuilding B19,1st /f_loor, Smart Village, KM 28 Cairo - Alexandria Desert Road\\\\n    content_length: 64692\\\\n    word_count: 9750\\\\n    processing_timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:41:10.250187\\\\n    status: success\\\\n\\\\n  -     filename: Lexology-In-Depth-Corporate-Governance-Corporate-Governance_-Egypt.pdf\\\\n    filepath: C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\amros\\\\\\\\Downloads\\\\\\\\iVolution\\\\\\\\data\\\\\\\\Lexology-In-Depth-Corporate-Governance-Corporate-Governance_-Egypt.pdf\\\\n    file_extension: .pdf\\\\n    mime_type: application/pdf\\\\n    metadata:       size_bytes: 203113\\\\n      created_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:15.559394\\\\n      modified_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:16.003032\\\\n      file_hash: 90175c33902864819152acfdf6d9958b6bb09a32d7018ce098fe41edbffd505f\\\\n\\\\n    content: --- Page 1 ---\\\\nIN-DEPTH\\\\nCorporate \\\\nGovernance\\\\nEGYPT\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 2 ---\\\\nCorporate Governance\\\\nEDITION 15\\\\nContributing Editor\\\\nWill Pearce\\\\nDavis Polk & Wardwell LLP\\\\nIn-Depth: Corporate Governance  (formerly The Corporate Governance Review) is a useful \\\\noverview of the corporate governance regimes in key jurisdictions worldwide.

However, additional laws and \\\\nregulations could be applied based on, for example, the activity and listing status of the \\\\nrelevant company. These laws and regulations include, for example:\\\\n1.Investment Law No.72 of 2017 (the Investment Law) and its executive regulations;\\\\n2.Capital Market Law No.95 of 1992 and its executive regulations;\\\\n3.Governance Rules for Non-Banking Financial Activities No.100 of 2020 (the \\\\nGovernance Rules);\\\\n4.the General Authority for Investments and Free Zones (GAFI) circulars and guides;\\\\n5.the Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) circulars and guides; and\\\\n6.the Listing and Delisting Rules No.11 of 2014 (the Listing Rules).\\\\nGAFI and FRA are mainly empowered to oversee companies and regulate the corporate \\\\ngovernance framework. It is important to highlight that FRA, along with the Egyptian \\\\nExchange (EGX), primarily enforces and monitors the regime for listed companies.\\\\nGAFI has been working hard for years to simplify the corporate governance process, \\\\nespecially after the covid-19 pandemic and the overarching state policy for improving \\\\nthe overall regulatory framework as part of the improvement initiatives for foreign direct \\\\ninvestment (FDI) in Egypt. As an example, GAFI allowed corporate bodies\\\\' meetings to be \\\\nheld online including, inter alia, ordinary general assembly meetings (OGMs), extraordinary \\\\ngeneral assembly meetings (EGMs) and board of directors meetings. Furthermore, GAFI \\\\nstarted to minimise the number of documents required for the purpose of reviewing and \\\\ncertifying the minutes of the meetings as highlighted below.\\\\nIt is worth nothing that incorporated companies (i.e., corporations) in Egypt may take the \\\\nform of joint stock company (JSC), limited liability company (LLC), limited partnership by \\\\nshares company (LPSC) and sole person company (SPC).\\\\nIn this chapter, we shed light on the regulation of JSCs, this being the standard process \\\\nthat shall, in general, apply to LLCs, LLCs, LPSCs and SPCs unless otherwise required by \\\\nlaw.\\\\nYear in review\\\\nDuring the past year, the corporate governance regime witnessed key developments and \\\\nimprovement milestones including, for example, the issuance by GAFI of several decrees \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nreducing the number of documents required by over 62 per cent. This streamlining aims \\\\nto ease procedures for all investors and business owners.\\\\nCorporate leadership\\\\nThe legal system in Egypt does not recognise the two-tier board of directors structure. Only \\\\nthe one-tier board system is recognised.\\\\nA JSC is, as a general rule, required to be managed by a board comprising at least three \\\\nmembers to be elected by the General Assembly for a term of three years, as speci’ed in \\\\nthe companyWs articles of association (AoA). A board meeting is generally considered valid \\\\nif attended by at least three members, unless the AoA requires a larger quorum.\\\\nIt is worth noting that there are other rules that apply to certain activities (such as \\\\nnon-banking ’nancial institutions and banks) and publicly listed JSCs. For example, for \\\\nJSCs engaged in non-banking ’nancial activities, the board must, in general, have a \\\\nmajority of non-executive directors, with at least half of these being independent directors. \\\\nAdditionally, these companies are required to have at least one female director on their \\\\nboard.\\\\nMoreover, it is also worth noting that a minimum of two female board directors is required \\\\nto be represented in listed companies, where at least 25 per cent of the total board \\\\nmembership needs to be women.\\\\nThe board must appoint a chair from among its members and may also designate a vice \\\\nchair. The vice chair acts on the chair\\\\'s behalf in the chair\\\\'s absence, and the board may \\\\nalso delegate one or more of its members for conducting a speci’ed activity or having a \\\\nspeci’ed duty and exercising some of the designated duties of the board.\\\\nFurthermore, the board may, as a general rule, grant the chair the authority of a managing \\\\ndirector for JSCs that are not publicly listed. JSCs shall be represented in court by either \\\\nthe chair or the chief executive oUcer (CEO), in accordance with the companyWs AoA.\\\\nThe board is generally required to, inter alia:\\\\n1.undertake all the duties arising from the business of the company they manage, and \\\\nact for its best interest;\\\\n2.convene the board meetings and call for the OGMs and EGMs;\\\\n3.prepare ’nancial statements and report on the companyWs activities and ’nancial \\\\nstatus; and\\\\n4.submit all the mandatory key declarations on behalf of the company and maintain \\\\nthe companyWs commercial ledgers and mandatory registers.\\\\n•ith regard to the chairWs control over the board, it is necessary to note that the chairWs \\\\nrole includes, inter alia: (1) representing the company before courts; (2) calling the board \\\\nmeetings to convene; (3) calling the OGM and EGM general assembly meetings to convene; \\\\nand (4) performing whatever roles are designated to the chair by the AoA. Moreover, the \\\\nchair is generally empowered to sign and conclude transactions on behalf of the company, \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nand any other authorised members of the board, unless decided otherwise by the general \\\\nassembly.\\\\nThe delegation of powers from the chair to the vice chair is addressed in the Companies \\\\nLaw, which states that the vice chair replaces the chair in their absence and notes that \\\\nappointing a vice chair is not mandatory. The board may also delegate one of its members \\\\nfor conducting a speci’ed activity or more or having speci’ed duty and exercise some of \\\\nthe designated duties of the board.\\\\nThe separation of roles between the chair and the CEO is determined by the responsibilities \\\\nand competencies speci’ed in the company\\\\'s AoA. It is also important to highlight that \\\\nthere are distinct differences between the roles of the chair and the CEO. Speci’cally, the \\\\nCEO does not have the authority to call for the board of directors meetings or OGMs.\\\\nMoreover, it is prohibited for listed companies and companies undertaking non-’nancial \\\\nbanking activities to combine the position of the chair and the CEO.\\\\nThe managing director and members of the board of directors are entitled to remuneration; \\\\nhowever, the OGM is, in general, the corporate body that determines lump sum payments, \\\\nattendance allowances and other bene’ts prescribed for members of the board of \\\\ndirectors.\\\\nThe board committees are given a de’nition under the Companies Law as committees \\\\nformed by the members of the board (the non-executive and independent members) \\\\nfor organisational purposes through distributing certain work between its members. It \\\\nmay also authorise one of its members or a committee to carry out speci’c job, or to \\\\nsupervise an area of the companyWs activity, or to exercise some of the powers or functions \\\\nassigned to the board. Moreover, the Governance Rules introduced several types of board \\\\ncommittees, including, inter alia, the audit committee, the remuneration committee, the \\\\nnomination committee, the risk management committee and the governance committee. \\\\n•e would like to emphasise that the main responsibility of the committees is limited to \\\\nsubmitting recommendations to the board, which is the decision-making authority; the \\\\nboard can amend the recommendations and revoke the committees.\\\\nIt is important to highlight that, with regard to the non-banking ’nancial activities, related \\\\ncompanies are obliged to establish an audit committee and in some cases the companies \\\\nare obliged to establish a governance committee as well.\\\\n•ith regard to the board role in share issuance, the board may increase the issued capital \\\\nof the company within the authorised capital by virtue of a resolution of the boardWs \\\\nmeeting. This authorised capital is deemed a pre-authorisation by the shareholders to the \\\\nboard to increase the issued capital within a speci’c limit, which should not exceed 10 \\\\ntimes of the issued capital. This pre-authorisation needs to be used within a speci’c time \\\\nframe and is considered an exceptional process from the main process that needs to be \\\\nfollowed for obtaining the shareholdersW approval.\\\\nThe AoA may require obtaining the prior approval of the board before the transfer of \\\\nshares, and in the event the board rejects the transfer of shares, the board may purchase \\\\nthese provided that they do not exceed 10 per cent of the total issued shares of the \\\\ncompany. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that within one year of the purchase date \\\\nthe company must: (1) transfer the shares to a third party; (2) distribute the purchased \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nshares to all the shareholders of the company as free shares; or (3) decrease the issued \\\\ncapital of the company by the amount of nominal value of the purchased shares.\\\\nThe Governance Rules de’ne an independent director as a non-executive director with \\\\nrelevant experience who is not aUliated with the company\\\\'s board, its senior management \\\\nor the parent company, and who does not hold an executive post in the company, and is \\\\nnot paid a monthly or annual salary, except compensation as a board member.\\\\nIn addition, this independent director is not a representative of the shareholders, and has \\\\nno material transactions with the company, and is not paid any salary, commission or fees, \\\\nexcept compensation as a board member. The independent director should neither have a \\\\npersonal interest in the company, nor be a relative by blood or marriage or otherwise up to \\\\nsecond degree relationship to any of its shareholders, board directors or executives. This \\\\nmember also should not be a senior oUcer, adviser or external auditor of the company \\\\nfor three years prior to their appointment. Importantly, their tenure of membership as an \\\\nindependent director should not exceed a maximum of six consecutive years, otherwise \\\\nthey will become a non-independent director.\\\\nThe general assembly may ’le a lawsuit against any director for any mistakes that have \\\\nnegatively impacted the company.\\\\nCon@icts of interest must be avoided by any board member, whereby any con@ict of interest \\\\nmatter must be reported to the board for approval. The relevant board member who has \\\\nthat con@ict of interest is prohibited from voting on a decision on that matter.\\\\nCorporate disclosure\\\\nOn 9 August 2023, the FRA issued a decision outlining the corporate governance rules \\\\napplicable to non-banking ’nancial activities companies.\\\\nThis decision presents a set of corporate governance rules, of which some regulate the \\\\ntransparency and disclosure requirements of non-banking ’nancial activities companies. \\\\nThese rules stipulate that non-banking ’nancial activities companies are required to:\\\\n1.disclose any material event that affects their activities and third parties dealing with \\\\nthe companies;\\\\n2.notify and provide the FRA with the key corporate structure information including the \\\\nshareholding structure for shareholders holding 5 per cent or more of the shareWs \\\\nthreshold, recent board structure, key employees structure, without prejudice to \\\\nnotifying the FRA with any amendment or modi’cation to the board structure or the \\\\nrelated internal board committees, and any convened OGMs within 10 days as of \\\\ntheir convocation, and any amendments made thereto;\\\\n3.provide the FRA with annual ’nancial statements, along with the auditorWs report \\\\nand the board of directors\\\\' report for review within 21 days of the convocation date \\\\nof the general meeting approving these ’nancial statements, and the non-banking \\\\n’nancial activities companies should comply with the applicable laws and refer the \\\\n’nancial statements to the general meeting for approval within a maximum period \\\\nof three months as of the end of the ’scal year. In addition, these companies are \\\\nrequired to submit quarterly ’nancial statements to the FRA, accompanied by a \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nlimited examination report from the auditor, within 45 days of the end of the period \\\\nfor which the ’nancial statements are submitted.\\\\nThe decision introduced an exception to the aforementioned disclosure requirements, \\\\nwhereby suspended companies are exempted from submitting the quarterly ’nancial \\\\nstatements throughout the suspension period.\\\\nFurthermore, the Listing Rules have also stipulated provisions regarding the corporate \\\\ndisclosure for companies listed on EGX as follows.\\\\n1.Each shareholder shall disclose to the EGX when exceeding or decreasing their \\\\nownership and associated parties to a ratio of 5 per cent and its multipliers from the \\\\nnumber of securities representing the company\\\\'s capital or voting rights, including \\\\nshares subscribed to by purchasing the underwriting rights, including disclosure \\\\nof the shareholder and its parties directly associated with the shares and foreign \\\\ndeposit certi’cates corresponding to the company\\\\'s shares as well as their indirect \\\\nownership through the ownership of 25 per cent or more of the capital of a company \\\\nor entity that in turn owns a ratio in the capital of the listed company to which this \\\\nshareholder contributes.\\\\n2.In addition to that, the shareholders referred to in the preceding point (a) are also \\\\nobliged to disclose the future investment plan and the shareholder\\\\'s directions \\\\nregarding the management of the company if the percentage purchased from it and \\\\nassociated parties is 25 per cent or more of the company\\\\'s capital or voting rights.\\\\n3.The provisions of the preceding points (a) and (b) apply to the members of the board \\\\nof the listed company and its employees and related parties upon completion of the \\\\nsale or purchase of one of the 3 per cent or multipliers of the company\\\\'s securities.\\\\nIt is also worth noting that, as per the amendments introduced by the Investment \\\\nLaw, any company in Egypt that has foreign direct or indirect investment contributions, \\\\nirrespective of its percentage, must comply with some speci’c reporting obligations \\\\nregarding corporate disclosure stipulated by the Executive Regulations of the Investment \\\\nLaw as follows:\\\\n1.the company shall submit an FDI report within 30 days of any changes to the \\\\ncompanyWs board structure, shareholder structure, capital or purpose;\\\\n2.the company shall submit the FDI report within 45 days of the end of each quarter \\\\n(i.e., the end of March, June, September and December); and\\\\n3.the FDI report must be submitted within four months of the ’scal yearWs end.\\\\nIn addition to that, according to a regulation issued in 2020 by the Minister of Supply and \\\\nInternal Trade, all companies must disclose the actual bene’ciaries also known as the \\\\nultimate bene’ciary owners (HBOs) who have a controlling interest or the actual control of \\\\nthe decision-making on the company and other information including the nationality and \\\\nID or passport numbers of the HBOs.\\\\nAccording to the Companies Law, the board is required to publish ’nancial statements, a \\\\ncomprehensive summary of its report and the full text of the auditorWs report prior to the \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\ngeneral assembly meeting, unless otherwise required by the AoA (such as sending the \\\\n’nancial statements directly to the shareholders).\\\\nA JSC is required to comply, inter alia, with the following audit requirements:\\\\n1.each JSC is required to appoint at least one auditor who shall be quali’ed to practise \\\\naccounting and auditing in Egypt, and where there is more than one auditor, the \\\\nappointed auditors shall be jointly liable towards the JSC; and\\\\n2.a JSC is required to allow the appointed auditor or auditors to: (1) access any \\\\ncompany ledger, books and documents; and (2) con’rm the existence of its \\\\ninventory as well as providing any required clari’cations or data.\\\\nEnvironmental, social and governance\\\\nIn July 2021, the FRA issued a Decree regulating the disclosure of environmental, social \\\\nand governance practices on sustainability and the ’nancial impacts of climate change by \\\\ncompanies engaged in non-bank ’nancial activities and companies listed on the Egyptian \\\\nExchange (EGX), requiring companies listed on the EGX, and companies operating in \\\\nnon-bank ’nancial activities to submit environmental, social and governance disclosure \\\\nreports related to sustainability. This Decree presents two levels of compliance as follows.\\\\nESG disclosure reports will be required from all companies whose securities are listed \\\\non the EGX in addition to companies operating in non-banking ’nancial activities whose \\\\nissued capital or net ownership rights are not less than 100 million Egyptian pounds.\\\\nCompanies whose issued capital or net ownership rights are not less than 500 million \\\\nEgyptian pounds and that are listed on the EGX and that are engaged in non-banking \\\\n’nancial activities will be required to complete disclosures concerning the ’nancial \\\\neffects of climate change in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial \\\\nDisclosures (TCFD), with their annual reports prepared by their board of directors and \\\\nattached to the annual ’nancial statements.\\\\nAs per the aforementioned Decrees, the report is submitted after ’lling out the attached \\\\nannual report forms to be completed and submitted to the FRA at the date of submission \\\\nof the ’nancial statements of the past ’scal year.\\\\nShareholders\\\\nThe Companies Law includes several provisions regarding the rights and powers of \\\\nshareholders in the participation and contribution of the company\\\\'s management. Each \\\\nshareholder has the right either personally or by proxy to attend, participate actively and \\\\nvote in OGMs or EGMs.\\\\nShareholders typically possess equal rights and obligations, including equal voting rights. \\\\nHowever, the AoA may grant speci’c privileges to certain classes of shares concerning \\\\nvoting, pro’t distribution and liquidation balances. It is important to note that voting \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nprivileges and liquidation balances are not combined. Additionally, shares of the same \\\\nclass must be treated equally in terms of advantages or restrictions.\\\\nThe shareholder has the right to request the board to convene the OGM where the number \\\\nof shareholders who want this own at least 5 per cent of the company\\\\'s capital. The \\\\nshareholder has the right to discuss the topics on the agenda of the general assembly and \\\\nto ask questions about them to the members of the board and the auditor. These questions \\\\nmust be answered to the extent that the company\\\\'s interests are not prejudiced.\\\\nAdditionally, the general assembly has the power at any time to remove and revoke the \\\\nboard or any of its members even if this is not mentioned in the agenda of the general \\\\nassembly meeting.\\\\nAs per the Companies Law, some decisions and actions must be taken by the approval of \\\\nthe shareholders upon the convening of an OGM or an EGM subject to their competencies \\\\nstipulated by the Law, including, but not limited to:\\\\n1.the election and removal of members of the board;\\\\n2.approving ’nancial statements;\\\\n3.distribution of dividends and the remuneration of the board;\\\\n4.liquidation of the company, amending rights, privileges and restrictions for types of \\\\nshares;\\\\n5.extending or shortening the term of the company;\\\\n6.resolving the company before its term;\\\\n7.changing  the  proportion  of  loss  that  results  in  the  company\\\\'s  compulsory \\\\ndissolution or incorporation;\\\\n8.approving the merger of the company;\\\\n9.increasing the companyWs issued capital by premium shares;\\\\n10.increasing the companyWs authorised capital;\\\\n11.reducing the capital of the company;\\\\n12.amending the AoA; and\\\\n13.considering the dissolution or continuation of the company, if the company\\\\'s losses \\\\nin one or more ’nancial years amount to half the value of shareholders\\\\' equity \\\\naccording to the latest approved annual ’nancial statements of the company.\\\\nThe Companies Law granted the dissenting shareholders who attended the general \\\\nassembly meetings, and the shareholders who did not attend the meeting for a valid \\\\nreason, the right to annul the resolutions issued in favour of speci’c shareholders. It \\\\nalso grants them the right to annul the resolutions issued that harm them, or that bring \\\\nspecial bene’t to members of the board or others without regard to the interests of the \\\\ncompany. Moreover, any resolutions of the general assembly issued in contravention to \\\\nthe provisions of the AoA will be void, in accordance with the Companies Law.\\\\nThe OGM is concerned with the approval of the management report prepared by the board \\\\nfor the companyWs activities during the ended ’scal year. In addition, the OGM also is tasked \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nwith the discharge of the members of the board from all their duties for the ended ’scal \\\\nyear.\\\\n•ith respect to the quorum of attendees at the OGM, as per the Companies Law, the OGM \\\\nshall be valid only if it is attended by shareholders representing at least one quarter of \\\\nthe capital unless the AoA provides for a higher percentage on condition that it does not \\\\nexceed half of the capital as a minimum.\\\\nDecisions of the general assembly shall be taken, as a general rule, by an absolute majority \\\\nof the number of votes of the shares of the shareholders represented at the meeting, unless \\\\nthe AoA require a higher percentage.\\\\nShareholders holding at least 5 per cent of capital shares can request the inclusion of \\\\nspeci’c topics to the agenda as to be discussed in the general assembly, which guarantees \\\\nthat minority shareholdersW voices and opinions are heard and taken into consideration.\\\\nIn addition to that, minority shareholders have access to information since minority \\\\nshareholders have the right to access the companyWs ’nancial statements, audit \\\\nreports and other important documents. This transparency ensures their inclusion in \\\\nthe company\\\\'s management and helps them to deliver informative opinions. Also, \\\\nshareholders having at least 10 per cent shares of the capital are eligible to request a \\\\n’nancial audit or investigation into suspicious acts of the company\\\\'s management.\\\\nAll related-party transactions must be disclosed and pre-approved by the general assembly, \\\\nin order to be monitored by minority shareholders that will have the right to vote on these \\\\ntransactions to ensure that they are not used to bene’t insiders at the expense of the \\\\ncompany and other shareholders. This grants them the opportunity to be aware of any \\\\nrestructuring happening within the company group that could affect them.\\\\nAoA may include some measures and regulations with respect to the transfer of shares (in \\\\nacquisitions). AoA may contain speci’c rules governing share trading, but may not remove \\\\nthe shareholder\\\\'s right to transfer their shares; share trading may include mandatory prior \\\\napproval of the companiesW management or approval from the board as the case may be.\\\\nIf the transfer of shares is subject to a right of ’rst refusal, then the following general rules \\\\nshall apply:\\\\n1.request submission: Shareholders wishing to sell their shares need to submit a \\\\nformal request to the company. This request must include essential information \\\\nsuch as the shareholder\\\\'s name, address, the number and type of shares being \\\\nsold and the proposed sale price. The request can be sent via registered mail or \\\\ndelivered in person to the company\\\\'s headquarters, with a receipt needed to con’rm \\\\nthe submission date;\\\\n2.approval timeline: The company has 60 days to respond to the request. If \\\\nthe company does not respond within this period, the request is automatically \\\\nconsidered approved;\\\\n3.objection process: If the board or the managing partners object to the sale, they \\\\nmust act within 60 days of notifying the shareholder. They have two options, namely:\\\\nIpropose an alternative buyer: The board can suggest another buyer, either \\\\nfrom existing shareholders or outside the company, to purchase the shares; \\\\nand\\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nIbuy the shares themselves: The board may choose to buy back the shares, \\\\neither to reduce its capital or for other legal reasons; and\\\\n4.deemed approval: If the board does not take any action within the speci’ed period, \\\\nthe inaction is interpreted as approval of the transfer, allowing the shareholder to \\\\nproceed with the sale.\\\\nThis framework is intended to regulate share transfers while protecting the companyWs \\\\ninterests and ensuring that shareholders can still transfer their shares under speci’ed \\\\nconditions.\\\\n•ith respect to the mandatory reporting to shareholders, the board of directors shall \\\\nprovide the shareholders with the following information:\\\\n1.a detailed description or report, including all the expenses by the board and all \\\\nrelevant privileges; and\\\\n2.’nancial statements and management reports.\\\\nIt should be noted that shareholders typically receive information about upcoming \\\\nmeetings, including agendas, ’nancial statements and other relevant documents at least \\\\n23 days (and at least 30 for provision of the ’nancial statements, management reports \\\\nand the auditorWs report) before the meeting. This time frame can vary depending on the \\\\ntype of data and information disclosed.\\\\nProxy solicitation is commonly practised; shareholders often receive proxy materials, \\\\nallowing them to vote on matters without attending the meeting in person. This \\\\nfacilitates participation, especially for those unable to attend. Moreover, it is common for \\\\nshareholders to express their views in advance of conveying the relevant general assembly \\\\nmeetings.\\\\nOutlook and conclusions\\\\nThe legal and regulatory framework governing corporate governance in Egypt has \\\\nundergone signi’cant reforms aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability and \\\\noperational eUciency within the corporate sector. The laws and regulations have set \\\\nforth guidelines intended to align practices with international standards. However, despite \\\\nthese advancements, challenges persist in the implementation phase. Issues such as \\\\nlack of coordination between the relevant governmental authorities continue to hinder the \\\\neffective application of the governance frameworks.\\\\nOverall, the developments within corporate governance have begun to foster a more \\\\nfavourable investment climate in Egypt such as the issuance of several decrees by \\\\nGAFI to reduce the number of documents required regarding corporate governance \\\\nprocedures. These decrees are intended to streamline the use of online services for \\\\ncorporate governance procedures including, for example, the incorporation of companies \\\\nand protecting the minorities of the listed companies from the optional delisting from \\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n\\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\n RETURN TO SUMMARY\\\\nEGX by issuing decrees that limit the powers of the majority of shareholders in listed \\\\ncompanies.\\\\n•e expect that the development strategy of the corporate governance rules in Egypt \\\\nwill focus on increasing the use of technology, online services, eliminating routine and \\\\npaper-based procedures and implementing the global corporate governance standards. \\\\nThis will result in companies complying properly with corporate governance rules, \\\\naccelerating and facilitating corporate governance procedures and attracting further \\\\ninvestments to Egypt.\\\\nMohamed Hashish m.hashishJshandpartners.com\\\\nRana El Helbawi r.elhelbawiJshandpartners.com\\\\nAhmed Nour a.nourJshandpartners.com\\\\nAbdallah Elmasry a.elmasryJshandpartners.com\\\\nSoliman, Hashish & Partners\\\\nRead more from this 3rm on Lexology\\\\nCorporate Governance | Egypt Explore on Lexology\\\\n    content_length: 29507\\\\n    word_count: 4553\\\\n    processing_timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:41:10.474735\\\\n    status: success\\\\n\\\\n  -     filename: OCI 2025 AGM agenda.pdf\\\\n    filepath: C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\amros\\\\\\\\Downloads\\\\\\\\iVolution\\\\\\\\data\\\\\\\\OCI 2025 AGM agenda.pdf\\\\n    file_extension: .pdf\\\\n    mime_type: application/pdf\\\\n    metadata:       size_bytes: 345986\\\\n      created_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:25.898424\\\\n      modified_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:26.500268\\\\n      file_hash: 85c180022a1bdfbc9afb237885a06dcf744b2d13725145107d2dcd060b42a1f0\\\\n\\\\n    content: --- Page 1 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 1 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nAGENDA AND EXPLANATORY NOTES TO  \\\\nTHE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF  SHAREHOLDERS OF  \\\\nOCI N.V.  \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V.

The market price is defined as the average closing  price of the ordinary shares on Euronext \\\\nAmsterdam o n the five trading days prior to the date of the repurchase , provided that for self -tender \\\\noffers, accelerated repurchase arrangements and other similar repurchase programs as determined by \\\\nthe Board  of Directors , the market price shall be the average of the closing  price of the ordinary shares on \\\\nEuronext Amsterdam during a period as determined by the Board  of Directors , which shall be at least one \\\\ntrading day .  \\\\n \\\\nResolutions by the Board of Directors to repurchase  shares can only be adopted with the consent of the \\\\nmajority of the Non -Executive Directors.   \\\\n \\\\nIn light of OCI\\\\'s strategic review , the Company’s substantial transformation  and the potential for further \\\\nextraordinary  cash distributions  to shareholders , the Board of Directors considers it prudent  at this \\\\njuncture to maximise  the Company’s  flexibility and its available p athways to effect such  future returns of \\\\ncapital ; these pathways include but are not limited to ordinary  cash dividends from the profit reserve , \\\\nfurther capital repayments (see agenda item 13 below) and share repurchases as included in this agenda \\\\nitem . The Board of Directors is there fore seeking the authority to repurchase up to a maximum of 30% of \\\\nthe total  issued share capital as of the date of the General Meeting , greater than  the 10%  standard \\\\nauthorisation granted in previous years . As set out in more detail under item 12, the Board of Directors \\\\nwill resolve to cancel any shares held by the Company in excess of 10% of the issued share capital.   \\\\n \\\\nItem 12 – Proposal to cancel shares in the share capital of the Company ( resolution ) \\\\nIt is proposed by the Board of Directors with the consent of the Non -Executive Directors, to cancel some  \\\\nor all shares in the share capital of the Company held or repurchased by the Company under the \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 6 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\nauthorization referred to under agenda item 11 above. This cancellation may be executed in one or more \\\\ntranches. The number of shares that will be cancelled (whether or not in a tranche) will be determined by \\\\nthe Board of Directors , provided that the Board of Directors will in any event cancel all shares the Company \\\\nmay hold in excess of 10% of the Company\\\\'s issued share capital.   \\\\n \\\\nPursuant to the relevant statutory provisions, cancellation may not be effectuated until two months after \\\\nthe resolution to cancel has been adopted and publicly announced (this will apply to each tranche).  \\\\n \\\\nItem  13 – Two proposals to amend the Articles of Association to facilitate a capital repayment  (one \\\\ncombined resolution ) \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction  \\\\nThe Company proposes the payment of an extraordinary interim cash distribution of up to USD 1 billion  \\\\nin total  subject to closing of  the sale of 100% of the Company\\\\'s  equity interests in its Global Methanol \\\\nBusiness, to Methanex Corporation, as announced on 9 September 2024 , the strategic review and Board \\\\napproval.  \\\\n \\\\nIn this connection, the General Meeting will be requested to resolve on two subsequent amendments to \\\\nthe Articles of Association to facilitate that the extraordinary interim cash distribution can be made as a \\\\nrepayment of capital or, at the election of the  shareholder, as a payment from the profit reserve, subject \\\\nto Dutch Dividend Withholding tax.  Shareholders that do not make a choice, will participate in the \\\\nrepayment of capital. A choice for one option implies an opt -out of the other option.  \\\\n \\\\nIn addition, shareholders will have the opportunity to elect a payment in EUR instead of USD. The \\\\nCompany will make a distribution in USD unless the relevant shareholder has opted for a distribution in \\\\nEUR. The applicable USD/EUR exchange rate will be dete rmined by the Board of Directors  based on an \\\\nauthoritative source.  \\\\n \\\\nThe amount that will be repaid to shareholders has not yet been determined and remains subject to the \\\\ndiscretion of the Board of Directors  provided that the amount that will be distributed shall not exceed \\\\nUSD 1 billion in total , respectively the EUR equivalent thereof.    \\\\n \\\\nFurther details  on the distribution  will be announced by the Company  in a timely  manner  before the \\\\ndistribution  become s payable .  \\\\n \\\\nProposals to amend the Articles of Association twice in connection with the capital repayment  \\\\nIt is proposed to the General Meeting under this agenda item 13 to amend the Articles of Association \\\\ntwice in accordance with the proposed draft deed s of amendment as reflected in a triptych in Dutch and \\\\nin an unofficial English translation, which is available on the Company\\\\'s website  (www.oci -global.com ) as \\\\nwell as at the Company\\\\'s offices.  \\\\n \\\\nThe resolution to amend the Articles of Association twice also includes the authorization of each member \\\\nof the Board of Directors  as well as each lawyer and paralegal practising with De Brauw Blackstone \\\\nWestbroek N.V. to execute the two notarial deeds of amendment to the Articles of Association.  \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 7 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPursuant to the first amendment, the nominal value per share  will be increased with an EUR amount which \\\\nequals the amount of the USD distribution taking into account the exchange rate selected by the Board of \\\\nDirectors  as described above (subject to an upward adjustment due to rounding). The amount of the \\\\nincrease will not exceed the maximum amount of the decrease described below.  \\\\n \\\\nPursuant to the second, subsequent amendment, the nominal value of the shares will be reduced again \\\\nto the original amount of EUR 0.02. The amount of the reduction per share , as yet to be determined by \\\\nthe Board of Directors , will be distributed to the Company\\\\'s shareholders as a repayment of capital \\\\n(subject to the election mechanism described above).  \\\\n \\\\nThis voting item requires a simple majority of votes cast if 50% or more of the issued share capital is \\\\nrepresented. If less than 50% of the issued share capital is represented, this proposal can only be adopted \\\\nby a majority of at least two -thirds of the votes cast.  \\\\n \\\\nCapital reduction requirements  \\\\nPursuant to Dutch law, the reduction of capital is subject to a formal procedure. This procedure entails \\\\ncustomary filings with the Dutch Trade Register and observation of a two -month creditor opposition \\\\nperiod as described in Section 2:100 of the Dutch Ci vil Code. For purposes of these filings the maximum \\\\naggregate amount of the distribution must be specified. Solely for this purpose  an aggregate maximum \\\\ndistribution of EUR 5.47 per share will be taken into account.  \\\\n \\\\nUnder the provisions of Section 2:100 of the Dutch Civil Code, creditors may lodge objections to the capital \\\\nreduction within a period of two months following the announcement of the filing of the resolution to \\\\nreduce the share capital with the Dutch Trade Register. The amendment to the Articles of Association \\\\neffecting the capital reduction may only be implemented after such two -month creditor opposition period \\\\nhas lapsed, provided that no creditor objections have been received by the Amsterdam District Co urt or, \\\\nin the event objections have been received, after such opposition has been withdrawn, resolved or lifted \\\\nby an enforceable court order by the relevant court in the Netherlands. The amendments to the Articles \\\\nof Association, as well as the distribut ion, shall only take place thereafter.  \\\\n \\\\nItem 14 – Proposal to appoint PWC as auditor charged with the auditing of the Annual Accounts for the \\\\nfinancial year 202 5 (resolution)  \\\\nIt is proposed to instruct PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. to audit the Annual Accounts for the \\\\nfinancial year 202 5. \\\\n \\\\nItem  15 - Proposal to appoint PWC as auditor charged with the assurance of the Sustainability Reporting \\\\nfor the financial year 2025  (resolution)  \\\\nIn anticipation of , and subject to  (i) the transpo sition of the Corporate Sust ainability Rep orting Directive \\\\n(CSRD) into Dutch law  and (ii) applicability of such law to OCI during the financial year 2025 , it is proposed \\\\nto appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. as auditor to carry out the  mandatory  limited \\\\nassurance review of the Sustainability Reporting for the financial year 2025.  \\\\n \\\\n=====================================================================================  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nPage 8 of 12 \\\\n \\\\nOCI N.V., Honthorststraat 19, 1071 DC  AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands Tel: +31 20 723 4500  \\\\nTrade Register No. 56821166   VAT No. 852317384B01  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nBIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS  REQUIRED UNDER ARTICLE 14(3) OF THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION  \\\\n \\\\nMr. Nassef Sawiris  \\\\n \\\\nYear of birth:  1961   \\\\nNationality: Egyptian  and Belgian  citizen  \\\\n \\\\nProfile and current positions: Mr. Nassef Sawiris is the Executive Chair of the Company .

At the heart of Sharia law are the maqasid Al-Sharia \\\\nhigher objectives aimed at safeguarding and promoting faith, life, intellect, lineage, \\\\nand wealth. These principles closely parallel the core principles of sustainability, \\\\nwhich focus on meeting present needs while ensuring future generations can \\\\nprosper.\\\\nRESILIENT ISLAMIC BANKING\\\\nAs an Islamic bank, ADIB Egypt is inherently resilient due to its risk-sharing financial \\\\nmodel, ethical investment principles, and emphasis on real economic activity. By \\\\nutilizing asset-backed financing, the Bank ensures that transactions are tied to \\\\ntangible assets, reducing financial vulnerabilities and promoting long-term stability. \\\\nThis approach minimizes speculative risks and strengthens economic resilience, \\\\ncontributing to a more sustainable and stable financial system.\\\\nETHICAL FINANCE, GROWING ECONOMY\\\\nADIB Egypt adheres to Sharia principles and promotes sustainability by integrating \\\\nethical practices into its operations and financing. The Bank is committed to \\\\nupholding human rights and ethical labor practices by offering fair wages and \\\\nopposing any form of exploitation, harm, or unethical labor practices. \\\\nThe Bank also ensures fairness in financial transactions by prohibiting interest, \\\\nfostering an economy built on shared risk and social equity. Additionally, ADIB \\\\nEgypt also prohibits financing activities linked to ethically and health-harmful \\\\nindustries, such as alcoholic beverages. \\\\nBy promoting ethical investments, ADIB Egypt encourages individuals to actively \\\\nparticipate in the economy while discouraging idle money. Through profit-sharing \\\\nmodels like Mudarabah, the Bank channels funds into Sharia-compliant businesses, \\\\ndriving continuous economic activity, job creation, and long-term sustainable \\\\ndevelopment. \\\\nENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP IN ISLAM\\\\nADIB Egypt upholds the Sharia principle of stewardship of the Earth (Khilafah), \\\\nwhich calls for protecting natural resources and minimizing environmental harm. \\\\nThe Bank strictly avoids wastefulness (Israf) and excessive consumption, promoting \\\\na balanced and responsible use of resources. This commitment aligns with modern \\\\nsustainability efforts focused on resource conservation, pollution reduction, and \\\\nresponsible ecosystem management.\\\\nFurthermore, ADIB Egypt prohibits financing activities related to environmentally \\\\nharmful industries, such as tobacco production, and discourages the use of \\\\nproducts containing harmful chemicals that negatively impact human health and \\\\nthe environment. \\\\nBy integrating these principles into its operations, the Bank fosters an eco-\\\\nconscious approach to finance, ensuring that its economic activities support long-\\\\nterm sustainability and do not compromise the well-being of future generations. \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\n22 23\\\\nADIB Egypt sustainability Report 2024 ADIB Egypt sustainability Report 2024\\\\nPillars Strategic Objectives Relevant Capital Relevant Material TopicsEgypt’s Vision \\\\n2030 AlignmentSDGs \\\\nAlignment\\\\n1.

This process is guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 3: Material Topics and the \\\\nEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Stakeholder engagement remains central to the \\\\nassessment, allowing us to capture diverse perspectives and enhance the relevance and impact of our \\\\nfindings. \\\\nIn 2024, ADIB Egypt conducted a multi-phase materiality assessment process consisting of the following steps:\\\\nSTAKEHOLDER \\\\nIDENTIFICATION\\\\nWe began by mapping our broad range \\\\nof stakeholders, employees, customers, \\\\ninvestors, regulators, management, the \\\\nboard of directors, and the community.\\\\nDOUBLE MATERIALITY \\\\nAPPROACH\\\\nTo prioritise the most impactful topics,\\\\nADIB Egypt applied a scoring framework\\\\nthat assessed each issue from two \\\\ndimensions: financial and impact \\\\nmaterialityIDENTIFICATION\\\\nOF MATERIAL TOPICS\\\\nNext, we identified key topics critical to our \\\\nstrategic direction and resilience through:\\\\nActive stakeholder engagement to gather \\\\nvaluable insights into their concerns and \\\\nexpectations.\\\\nReview of regulatory obligations, including \\\\ncompliance with the Central Bank of Egypt \\\\n(CBE).\\\\nBenchmarking against ADIB Group and \\\\nindustry peers.\\\\nAlignment with ADIB’s strategic priorities \\\\nacross the short, medium, and long term.\\\\nConsideration of global sustainability \\\\ntrends, developments in the financial \\\\nsector, and Egypt’s national priorities.1\\\\n32This dual-lens approach known as double materiality ensures that our materiality matrix reflects \\\\nnot only what is important to ADIB’s financial success but also to the well-being of society and the \\\\nenvironment. The resulting matrix provides a clear view of our top sustainability priorities, guiding our \\\\nreporting, decision-making, and long-term strategy. \\\\nEvaluates how an environmental, \\\\nsocial,

The Code \\\\nserves as a guide for best practices in the fields  of governance, transparency and \\\\nprudent management, for all stakeholders of the company adopting the Code.  \\\\nThe importance of such update process stems from the significant  developments \\\\nwitnessed in the global arena in the area of governance principles , and the growing  \\\\ninterest of many entities in  this particular topic, be they inte rnational organizations; \\\\nfinancial  institutions; mutual funds  and investme nt companie s; retail investors; or \\\\ndifferent types of non -government al organizations.   \\\\nHence, the concerned  entity in Egypt – the Egyptian Institute of Directors EIoD – \\\\nhas had to keep abreast with these developments, and to adopt the best practices in \\\\nthis field. The EI oD was of the view that the Code should not be confined to a \\\\nparticular type of companies , but rather be general, so as to allow various \\\\ncompanies, public and private, to select the appropriate rules that fit them best.  \\\\nFor the purpose of up dating this Code, a working group has been formed of market \\\\nexperts and EI oD staff. Throughout several months,  the work ing group has revised \\\\nthe Code and has got acquainted with the best principles and applications adopted \\\\nby relevant international organiz ations.  \\\\nOn behalf of the EFSA Board  of Directors  and myself , we would like to extend our \\\\nsincere apprecia tion for the efforts made by this working group.    \\\\n \\\\nEgyptian Financial Supervisory Authority  \\\\n               Sherif Samy  \\\\n      Chairman  \\\\n \\\\n--- Page 4 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n4 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n Contents  \\\\n  Page  \\\\nIntroduction   6 \\\\nChapter One: General Framework of Corporate Governance  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.1 Egyptian Corporate Governance Code  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.2 The Role of the State , Legislative and Regulatory \\\\nEntities  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.3 Concept of Corporate Governance  9 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.4 Objectives and Benefits  of Implementing \\\\nCorporate Governance Principles  10 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.5 Scope of A pplication  11 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.6 The “ Comply or Explain” Rule  11 \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 1.7 References Used in Drafting the Egyptian \\\\nCorporate Governance Code  11 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 1.8 Definitions  13 \\\\n \\\\nChapter Two: Main Pillars  of Corporate Governa nce  17 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.1 First Pillar : General Assembly  of Shareholders  17 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.2 Second Pillar: Board  of Directors  19 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.3 Third Pillar : Board  Committees  27 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 2.4 Fourth Pillar : Control  Environment  34 \\\\n \\\\nChapter Three: Disclosure and Transparency  41 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 3.1 Introduction to Disclosure and Transparency  41 \\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n5 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n \\\\uf0b7  3.2 Material Information , and Financial and Non-\\\\nFinancial Disclosure  41 \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 3.3 Investor Relations                                                             42 \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 3.4 Disclosure Tool s 45 \\\\n  \\\\nChapter Four: Corporate Governance Codes, Charters  and Policies  51 \\\\n              First: Codes and Charters  51 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.1 Code of  Ethics and Business Conduct  51 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.2.Board  of Directors ’ Charter   51 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.3 Board  Committees  Charters  52 \\\\n             Second: Policie s 52 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.4 Succession Planning  Policy  52 \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 4.5.

The Code came in recognition of the important  \\\\nrole the public business sector plays in the Egyptian economy, as it comprises a \\\\ncluster of leading companies engaged in all types  of strategic industries in the \\\\ncountry. The Code affirms the role of the State; being the owner of this vital sector, \\\\nenhances the sector’s controls and supervision and ensures its effective operation.  \\\\nIn 2011, seeking to keep up  to date  with the best pra ctices at the international and \\\\nregional levels, in terms of the roles of Board s of directors, the EI oD revised  the \\\\nCorporate Governance Code for listed companies , in line with the governance  \\\\nguidelines at the time. The EI oD recommended that the various co ntrols in \\\\ncompanies b e activated. It also tackled Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) . \\\\nApplication of the “ Comply or Explain” rule was also recommended.  \\\\n \\\\nWhat is new in this version of  the Egyptian Corporate Governance Code?   \\\\nThe EI oD worked on upgrading an d updating the previous codes, consolidating \\\\nthem into one single code, bearing the name  of “Egyptian Corporate Governance \\\\nCode”. To do so, the EI oD:  \\\\nFirst : has broadened the application of the last version of the Code, in terms of \\\\ngenerality and comprehe nsiveness , capturing to this end the latest international and \\\\nregional practices a nd standards in good governance  and addressing the full \\\\nspectrum  of companies in Egypt according to their nature, complexity and size, \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n7 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n and in a manner that allows them the freedom  to apply what fits them best, and to \\\\nset future plans to address the  remaining rules for  the effective functioning of \\\\ncorporate governance over the medium and long terms . The aim  is to ensure full \\\\napplication of good governance principles consistent with the company’s pace of \\\\ngrowth, complexity and size.  \\\\nSecond : has introduced the Code as  indicative  guidelines for all legislative and \\\\nregulatory bodies when enacting and updating regulations and legislation related to \\\\ncorporate governance in the Arab R epublic of Egypt.  \\\\nHereunder is an overview of the updates and modifications introduced to this \\\\nedition of Egyptian Corporate Governance Code:  \\\\na. Setting a general methodology in drafting the Governance Code, indicating \\\\nthe necessity of having in place an adva nced corporate governance manual  \\\\nin Egypt, and highlighting the important role assumed  by the State, its \\\\ngovernment and institutions in supporting the governance concept and \\\\napplications;  \\\\nb. Underscoring  the importance of good governance, and highlighting  the \\\\nbenefi ts that companies can gain from  its application ; \\\\nc. Clearly determining the scope of application of these principles, and the \\\\nextent of their compatibility with the nature and size of each company;  \\\\nd. Paying special attention to the “ Comply or E xplain ” rule, as a fundamental \\\\npillar  that paves the way for enforcing the implementation  of the  principles;  \\\\ne. Spreading the awareness  and knowledge  of concepts and terminologies  \\\\nemployed in the Code, to accelerate  users ’ understanding of its contents;  \\\\nf. Stressing  the role of the General Assembly  of Shareholders  in electing an \\\\neffective Board  of Directors  to achieve the company’s objectives;  \\\\ng. Placing greater  emphasis on  the role of the Board  of Directors ; as a key \\\\nelement in managing and directing the company, in additi on to  its main \\\\nresponsibility for the application of governance  principles . The Code  also \\\\ndealt with  the optimal composition of Board  of Directors , in terms of \\\\ndiversity  and responsibility . The Code also  illustrates the different types  of \\\\nBoard  Committees  that assist the Board  in performing its functions and \\\\nduties;  \\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n8 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n h. Addressing  in detail the role an d responsibilities of the Board  Secretary  in \\\\nthe organization , according to international best practices;   \\\\ni. Placing more focus on the components of control  enviro nment  and its \\\\nsignificant importance in any company, starting from internal control   \\\\nj. Emphasiz ing the role  on External Auditors , Internal Audit, Risk \\\\nManagement, and Compliance Departments; and recommending that each \\\\ncompany should have in place a departmen t for Corporate Governance;  in \\\\nlight of the key role they play;  \\\\nk. Shedding more light on Investor Relations  activity in listed companies ; \\\\nl. Tackling the various disclosure methods and tools ; and highlighting the \\\\nimportance of non-financial disclosure , clarifyi ng the material information  \\\\nthat should be disclosed by different periodic reports; and  \\\\nm. Suggesting policies, codes and manuals  that companies  should develop and \\\\napply, to organize their internal work in respect of corporate governance.  \\\\nThis Code aims to s upport and assist all companies that wish to understand and \\\\napply good governance as an integrated approach towards growth and \\\\nsustainability, thereby achieving EI oD’s mission  and strategy for the benefit of the \\\\ncompanies ’ stakeholders  and the national eco nomy at large .  \\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n9 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n Chapter One  \\\\nGeneral Framework of Corporate Governance  \\\\n \\\\n1.1 Egyptian Corporate Governance Code  \\\\nThe Egyptian Corporate Governance Code is considered a comprehensive and \\\\ngeneral framework of governance and its relevant issues. It encompasses a se t \\\\nof guiding rules of corporate governance, based on international and regional \\\\nbest practices, to serve as guidelines for the application of corporate \\\\ngovernance in all kinds of companies in Egypt. The Code also helps as a guide \\\\nto legislators in enacting  the regulatory legislation and instructions related to \\\\ngovernance applications. The Code does not contradict  with the Joint Stock \\\\nCompanies Law No. 159 of 1981 or its Executive Regulations; the Capital \\\\nMarket Law No. 95 of 1992 or its Executive Regulation s; or Egyptian \\\\nExchange Listing and Delisting Rules to be issued by the EFSA Board  of \\\\nDirectors.   \\\\n1.2 The role of the State , legislative and regulatory authorities  \\\\nThe State, represented by the government , and legislative and regulatory \\\\nbodies , plays a pivota l role in adopting a clear approach for a gradual and \\\\nobjectiv e development of the regulatory  system of corporate governance, that \\\\nallows for the application of the underlying principles outlined in this Code on \\\\nthe full spectrum of companies in Egypt, acc ording to their respective size, \\\\ncomplexity and nature of business, while assisting and supporting the entities \\\\nengaged in promoting and spreading public awareness of governance culture \\\\nand applications. The aim is to attain the overriding objective of rai sing the \\\\nstandard of application of governance principles by employing proper \\\\nmethods, which all stakeholders can reap their fruits, namely firmly \\\\nestablishing the concept of prudent management, enhancing transparency and \\\\ndisclosure, minimizing corruption,  and ensuring equitable treatment of all \\\\ninvestors, especially protection of the rights of small investors.  \\\\n1.3 Concept of corporate governance  \\\\nGenerally, corporate governance is the set of rules, principles and systems that \\\\ngovern the relationship between the  Board  of Directors , on one hand, and a \\\\n--- Page 10 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n10 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n company’s owners and other stakeholders, on the other hand, with a view to \\\\nachieving the best protection and alignment of interests of these parties.  \\\\n1.4 Objectives and benefits of implementing corporate governance  \\\\nEgypt ian companies ought  to implement and comply with governance \\\\nprinciples, not just for the sake of  complying with  laws and regulations, but \\\\nbecause these principles bring to the company numerous benefits. \\\\nAdditionally, they upgrade the investment climate , and boost economic growth \\\\nin general.  \\\\nCharacterized by  its applicability, corporate governance has several benefi ts, \\\\nnamely : \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Protects rights, not only the rights of the company’s shareholders, \\\\nowners, employees, but also the other stakeholders; such as custo mers, \\\\ncreditors, suppliers and state bodies, and ultimately protects the society \\\\nas a whole, as well as the environment in which the company operates;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Achieves  the best possible sustainability for companies;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Improves companies efficient operation and stren gthens control on \\\\ntheir performance;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Facilitates obtaining  the necessary funding and reduces capital cost;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Mitigates  the impact of risks and crisi s; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Seeks to avoid conflict of interests  in respect of transactions of insider s \\\\nand related parties; and  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Assist s the institutionalization of family  owned  firms. \\\\nBy implementing corporate governance, closed joint -stock companies can \\\\nmore easily list their shares on the Exchange. This requires the attention of \\\\nshareholder s and management of the company  to monitor the  implementation \\\\nof governance principles as a prelude to the company’s listing. The proper \\\\npreparation for eligibility for public offering or listing is guaranteed by a prior \\\\nsound implementa tion of governance principles.  \\\\nCorporate governance is a culture  that has to be inherent in  the company’s \\\\ncore, and should be adopted as its vision and long term strategy that has to be \\\\n--- Page 11 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n11 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n implemented on a n ongoing  basis, and not only on the short run. Accordingly, \\\\nthe expected role to be assumed by those managing compani es, financial \\\\ninstitutions, professional societies, business  associations, retail and institutional \\\\ninvestors is to spread and promote the culture of corporate governance, putting \\\\nthe present Principles into force, and deeming companies’ application of \\\\ncorporate governance as an indication  of their success and distinction . \\\\n1.5 Scope of application  \\\\nWithout prejudice to all applicable legislation and regulations governing the \\\\nbusiness of all  types of  companies in the Arab Republic of Egypt, these \\\\nPrinciples s hall apply to all listed and unlisted companies, banking  and non -\\\\nbanking  financial institutions, industrial, commercial and service companies , \\\\nregardless of their size and nature of activity, whether they are family firms, or \\\\npublicly owned.  \\\\nAlso integral to the foregoing is that sound corporate governance does not only \\\\nmean adhering to a set of principles and interpr eting them narrowly and \\\\nliterally , but it also means a culture and a mechanism that governs the \\\\nrelationship among the business owners, its Board of Directors  and \\\\nstakeholders. Therefore, the broader the application of good governance , the \\\\ngreater the benefit for the society as a whole.  \\\\n1.6 The “ Comply or Explain” principle  \\\\nAs a rule, and without prejudice to the mandatory compliance with laws a nd \\\\nregulations, a company  should  typically  seek to apply all the  relevant  \\\\nprinciples outlined in this Code. If it fails to do so, for whatever reason, the \\\\ncompany must provide an objective and justifiable explanation, in application \\\\nof the “comply or expla in” principle.  Every company is required to  consider \\\\nall the principles outlined in the present Code, specify  the principles it \\\\ncomplies with and those it deviates from, the justifications of non -compliance, \\\\nand its future plan for implementing them. This  report is to be posted on the \\\\ncompany’s website and be published in its annual report for shareholders.  \\\\n1.7  References used in drafting the Egyptian Corporate Governance Code  \\\\nIn drafting and developing this Code, the EI oD has relied on many references, \\\\nsalien t of which is the Organization of Economic Cooperation and \\\\nDevelopment (OECD) Principles of Corporate Governance issued in 199 9, and \\\\ntheir amendments in 2004 and in 2015 introduced in the six main principles \\\\n--- Page 12 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n12 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n that serve as a general benchmark of corporate g overnance all over the world. \\\\nThese principles are namely:  \\\\ni. General Framework:  this principle emphasizes the need to have in place an \\\\neffective corporate governance framework that ensures markets  transparency \\\\nand efficiency, and compli es with applicable leg islations and laws. The \\\\nsegregation of responsibilities among the different legislative and \\\\nsupervisory authorities should be clearly articulated;  \\\\nii.  The Rights and Equitable Treatment of Shareholders:  the corporate \\\\ngovernance framework should protect all sh areholder s’ rights, and ensure \\\\nequitable treatment of them all, including small  shareholders  and foreign \\\\nshareholders. Equally crucial is to make sure that all shareholders have the \\\\nopportunity to obtain actual indemnity , should their rights be violated;  \\\\niii. The Role of Institutional Investors, and other Intermediaries in Stock \\\\nMarkets:  the corporate governance framework should provide economic \\\\nincentives to institutional investors and other intermediaries in stock \\\\nmarkets throughout the investment chain to ens ure efficient functioning of \\\\nstock markets and optimal application of good corporate governance;  \\\\niv. The Role of Stakeholders:  the corporate governance framework should \\\\nensure that the rights of stakeholders established by law are recognized and \\\\nrespected. Als o important is to encourage cooperation between companies  \\\\nand different stakeholders to maximize wealth, create employment  \\\\nopportunities and achieve sustainability of financially sound enterprises;  \\\\nv. Disclosure and Transparency:  the corporate governance fram ework \\\\nshould ensure that timely and accurate disclosure is made on all significant \\\\nmatters leading to material developments affecting the company , including \\\\nthe financial situation, performance , ownership structure, and management  \\\\nof the company;  and \\\\nvi.  The Responsibilities of the Board  of Directors: the corporate governance \\\\nframework should provide  strategic guidance to the company,  and ensure s \\\\nthe effective monitoring of the executive management by the Board , and \\\\nthe Board ’s accountability to the company a nd the shareholders.  \\\\nThe EIoD was  also guided by some key references for updating the Code,  \\\\nincluding:  \\\\n--- Page 13 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n13 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 Cadbury’s Report issued in the United Kingdom in 1999;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Corporate Governance Methodology  developed by  IFC, at the World Bank \\\\nGroup ; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Corporate Governance Regulations for Banks, issued by the Central Bank \\\\nof Egypt in 2011;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 The Principles drafted by the International Organization of Securities \\\\nCommissions (IOSCO) ; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Egyptian Exchange Listing and Delisting Rules, issued by EFSA in  Janua ry \\\\n2014, and their amendme nts; and  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Different regulations on corporate governance issued by EFSA.  \\\\nThe international and regional bes t practices have been reviewed , along with the \\\\nexperience of the different countries in implementing corporate governance, as \\\\nmain pillars in developin g the corporate governance system  in Egypt.  \\\\n Definitions  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 General Assembly : means  a meeting  that encompasses all the \\\\ncompany’s owners or shareholders;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Minority  Shareholders : means  shareholders that have a non -controlling \\\\ninterest in a company’s equity;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Rela ted Parties and Group s: means any group that is under  actual \\\\ncontrol of the natural or juridical  shareholders , or that has  an agreement \\\\non coordination upon  voting in the meetings of the General Assembly  or \\\\nBoard  of Directors  of the company ; \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Control : means  any status , agreement or ownership of any percentage  of \\\\nshares, or interest, result s in controlling the appointment of the majority \\\\nof the Board  members, or influencing the decisions of the Board  or the \\\\nGeneral Assembly  of the company;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Board  of Directors : is the authority  elected by the General Assembly  \\\\nresponsible for setting objectives and strategies, and following up the \\\\nperformance of the management of the company pursuant to its articles \\\\nof association ;  \\\\n--- Page 14 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n14 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n \\\\uf0b7 Chairman of the Board  of Directors : is a membe r of the Board , \\\\nappointed by the other members of the Board  to chair the Board ’s \\\\nmeetings, and to be the  legal representative of the company;  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Managing Director : is the Board  member delegated by the Board  to \\\\ncarry out the actual management of the company, a nd to be at the top of \\\\nthe management  hierarchy .

While the company’s \\\\narticles of association may stipulate that only shareholders with a specific \\\\nnumber of share s may attend the General Assembly , this provision shall be \\\\ndeemed an exception to the rule that allow s any shareholder to attend these \\\\nmeetings, and shall only apply when the number of shareholders  are too \\\\nlarge that makes it difficult for the company to arrange for a place for the \\\\nmeeting. Importantly, the foregoing provision should not be used as a means \\\\nto ignore  or exclude  the minority shareholders.  \\\\n2.1.2 Participation in the General Assembly  \\\\nShareholders should be encouraged to attend the General  Assembly . To this \\\\nend, arrangements should be made for facilitating their participation, \\\\nincluding, inter alia, choice of the appropriate place and time. Companies \\\\nwith large number of members  can use  electronic means  and different \\\\ncommunication systems , according t o the international best practices, for \\\\nonline transmitting or recording  of the proceedings of the meeting for  \\\\nshareholders abroad or at home.  Equally crucial is to  facilitate shareholders’  \\\\nparticipation  procedures , provided that the company’s  bylaw and ar ticles of \\\\nassociation  should be observed , in respect of the procedures of calling for \\\\nthe General Assembly  and the method of running the meeting . \\\\n2.1.3 Procedures of the General Assembly  \\\\nA secretary for the General Assembly  and ballot teller s shall be appointed,  \\\\nprovided that they are not members of the General Assembly  or the Board  of \\\\nDirectors .  \\\\nThe General Assembly  shall be run in a way that allows shareholders to \\\\nexpress their views, according to  the company’s bylaw and articles of \\\\nassociation and consistent with the meeting’s  agenda. The company’s \\\\n--- Page 18 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n18 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n management has to provide a full and efficient disclosure of the issues  \\\\noutlined  in the agenda.   \\\\nAny issue  in the agenda of the ordinary or extraordinary General Assembly , \\\\nshould  be accompanied with relevant data a nd information that help \\\\nshareholders take their decisions . The intent of providing such information is \\\\nto allow shareholders to take  informed and sound decisions, and not just to \\\\nsatisfy the formalities  of the meeting. Answers  should be made to all \\\\nquesti ons and inquiries  raised by shareholders, even if submitted  before the \\\\nmeeting  for inclusion in the agenda, or rather  sufficient time  should be \\\\nallocated during the meeting for responses to such inquires .  \\\\n2.1.4 Resolutions of the General Assembly  \\\\nIt is recommen ded that  the “cumulative voting” system is adopted, provided \\\\nthat the company\\\\'s statute so stipulates. The aim is to ensure that all \\\\nshareholders are represented when electing Board  directors, so that the final \\\\nresults of such election reflect the relative  representation of all shareholders.  \\\\nWhen called for electing the Board  of Directors , shareholders should be \\\\nfurnished with short curriculum vitae about each candidate.  \\\\nVoting on the General Assembly \\\\'s resolutions should be accurately recorded. \\\\nIf a dispu te arises about the validity of some votes on all or any  resolutions \\\\nof the General Assembly , voting shall be taken , rendering  such votes valid \\\\nfor one time, and invalid for another time . The matter shall be later on  \\\\nreferred to the competent administrativ e or juridical body . This is meant to \\\\nkeep  the procedure of the General Assembly  uninterrupted in all \\\\ncircumstances.   \\\\nSubject to applicable laws and the company ’s articles of association , \\\\nminority shareholders holding not less than 5% of the company\\\\'s share \\\\ncapital are entitled to place  items on the General Assembly \\\\'s agenda, and to \\\\nfile objections  with the administrative  body to any resolutions  of the General \\\\nAssembly . In turn, the administrative body shall  suspend those  resolutions  \\\\npassed in favor of the  majority shareholders agai nst the minority \\\\nshareholders. Additionally, the General Assembly  must be called when 3 % \\\\nor more of  shareholders make a request , as specified  by law within the \\\\nframework of protecting the minority shareholder rights.   \\\\nThe Genera l Assembly  secretary shall record in the minute s of the meeting \\\\nall the discussions, events and resolutions brought about by  the meeting. The \\\\n--- Page 19 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n19 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n company should disclose the resolutions passed and the material  events \\\\noccurred, to all shareholders simultaneousl y. Minutes of the company’s \\\\nGeneral Assemblie s shall be posted on the company’s website, and shall be \\\\nmade available to the public as much as practicable.   \\\\nListed companies are required to promptly furnish  the EFSA and the \\\\nEgyptian  Stock  Exchange with the resolutions passed by the ordinary and \\\\nextraordinary General Assembly  immediately after the end of each meeting, \\\\nnot be later than the  commencement of the trading session next to the date of \\\\nthe relevant meeting. This is meant to ensure the fair availabil ity of the \\\\ninformation to all.  \\\\nWhen carrying out transactions with affil iated groups  or entering into related \\\\nparty transactions , the Board  of Directors  has to obtain the General \\\\nAssembly ’s prior approval, so that conflict of interests  can be avoided, \\\\nspecifically with major  shareholders, Board  members, insiders, or other \\\\nrelevant companies.  A related party  transaction must be carried out on an \\\\nunbiased and objective basis . The  relevant party to a related party \\\\ntransaction shall not be entitled to vote in the General Assembly . Related \\\\nparty  transactions should be implemented in such a way that does not \\\\njeopardize the interests of the company and other stakeholders. Equally \\\\nimportant is the full disclosure of all these  transactions, whether about the  \\\\nrelated  party transactions  offered  for the next year, or  those entered into in \\\\nthe previous year.      \\\\n2.2  Second Pillar : Board  of Directors  \\\\n2.2.1  Composition of the Board  of Directors  \\\\nSubject to the law and the company’s articles of association , the Board  of \\\\nDirectors  shall be made up of an adequate number of members that enable it \\\\nto perform  its functions a nd duties, including formation  of committee s. The \\\\nmajority of members must be non -executives, and at least two of them are \\\\nindependent members with technical and analy tical skills for the benefit of \\\\nthe Board  and the company. Guided by international best practices, the \\\\nBoard  composition  should ideally be made up of a diverse mix, unbiased to \\\\ngender  or faith. \\\\nIn all events, when electing independent non -executive members , \\\\nconsideration should be taken that a member can devote  the necessary time \\\\n--- Page 20 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n20 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n and care to the company, and that there is no conflict of interest with any \\\\nother commitments .  \\\\nSufficient information, data and description  about the company should be \\\\nfurnished  to incoming  Members of the Board  upon their appointment  to \\\\nensure that  they become  acquainted with all the general aspect s of the \\\\ncompany  and identify its strengths, weaknesses, managerial structure and its \\\\nfinancials , and all other matters that are necessa ry for performing their duties \\\\neffectively  and in the best possible way. The Board  Secretary acts as a \\\\nliaison between the Board  members, and between Board  members and top \\\\nmanagement  of the company .  \\\\nThe Board  of Directors shall elect the Chairman of the Board and shall \\\\nappoint the Managing D irector. It is not recommended that the posts  of the \\\\nChairman and Managing D irector be held by the same person. If splitting the \\\\ntwo posts  is not feasible , the reasons should be disclosed  in the company’s \\\\nannual report and on its website. In this case, an independent Deputy \\\\nChairman for the Board  of D irectors should be appointed, according to the \\\\ninternational best practices, to chair the meetings that discuss the \\\\nperformance of the executive management.       \\\\n2.2.2 Procedures  of Board  Meetings  \\\\nThe Board  of Directors  shall meet  at least once every three months. The \\\\nBoard  may, at its discretion, invite to its meetings any individuals from \\\\ninside or outside the company, to discuss issues related to the company. The \\\\nannual repor t of the company and report of the Board  of Directors  should \\\\ndisclose the number of meetings, names of members who failed to attend  the \\\\nmeetings of the Board  or its committee s. A member should by no means be \\\\nabsent for three Board  meetings  in a given  year.  Board  meetings  should be \\\\ncalled for at dates , venues , and under arrangements that facilitate the \\\\nmembers’ participation.  \\\\nMeetings of the Board  of Directors  may be convened via modern \\\\ncommunication means ; i.e. video conference, provided that the company’s  \\\\narticles of incorporation allow it . The Board  sets the rules governing the use \\\\nof such means  in its meetings and the remote participation of members.  \\\\n  \\\\n--- Page 21 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n21 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n  \\\\n2.2.3 Role  and Responsibilities of the Board  \\\\nThe Board  of D irectors  is the body entrusted  with running the company’s \\\\naffairs, by delegation of the General Assembly . Hence , the ultimate \\\\nresponsibility of the company rests with the Board , notwithstanding the \\\\ncommittee s it may form, or the authority it  may mandate  to other \\\\norganizational units  or individuals. The Board ’s accountability for the \\\\ncompany’s management rests with the General Assembly  of shareholders. \\\\nThe decisions of the Board  are taken by  a majority vote.  \\\\nIf the Board  is forced by unforeseeable circumstances to approve decisions \\\\nby circulation , all Board members should participate in the voting on such \\\\ndecisions.  \\\\nA company’s Board  of D irector plays a vital and critical role in setting the \\\\nstrategic goals  of the business , approving the general plans and policies \\\\ngoverning the operation of the company, supervising the performance of the \\\\nexecutive management, ensuring the efficiency of internal controls and risk \\\\nmanagement, determining the optimal method for application of good \\\\ngovernance, and endorsing professional policies and ethics that the \\\\ncompany’s employees have to observe to upgrade their performan ce and \\\\nconduct. Therefore, the Board ’s decisions have a significant impact on the \\\\ncompany’s performance, that’s why such decisions should be made in the \\\\nbest interest s of the company, ensuring preservatio n of its assets and \\\\nmaximization of shareholders wealth.   \\\\nA member of the Board  of D irectors should consider himself a \\\\nrepresentative of all shareholders, committed to act in the best interests of \\\\nthe company and in particular the interests of other stake holders, rather than \\\\nacting in favor of the group  he/she  represents, or which has voted for his/her  \\\\nappointment.  \\\\nResponsibilities and duties of the Board  of Directors  include, without \\\\nlimitation:  \\\\n\\\\uf0b7 Developing the  necessary mechanisms and systems that ensure \\\\ncompliance with laws, codes , and internal bylaws of the company by \\\\nall employees. The Board  shall also ensure that a n early warning  \\\\nsystem is in place for detection of  any breach or violation, and ensure \\\\n--- Page 22 ---\\\\nThe Egyptian Institute of Directors (EIoD ) \\\\n22 The Egyptian Co rporate Governance Code                                                              Third Release  \\\\n that the appropriate  and prompt  action be taken .

Corporate \\\\ngovernance in banks emerged owing to the breathtaking developments in financial markets, cash \\\\nflow globalization and technological development which increased the competitive pressures \\\\namong banks and non-bank financial institutions. Moreover, the growth of financial markets and \\\\nthe variety in the bank financial instruments highlighted the impor tance of risk measurement, \\\\nmanagement and control. T o realize this, innovative methods should be continuously devised to \\\\nmanage business and risk; and changes should be introduced to laws and oversight systems, with a \\\\nview to maintaining a sound banking system.\\\\nNational Bank of Egypt (NBE) pays great attention to sound governance practices. NBE\\\\'s Board \\\\nis committed to apply the best standards of professional performance to all the Bank business \\\\nactivities. In this respect, NBE complies with the regulations of Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) which \\\\nalways endeavours to develop the banking sector and maintain its integrity through the application \\\\nof best international and local governance practices.  \\\\nThis Manual was developed by NBE and was first approved by its Board of Directors (BoD) in \\\\n2012. The Manual is revised, updated and amended biannually or as necessary to meet the changing \\\\nrequirements of NBE and regulatory authorities and be in line with the best international practices. \\\\nAn updated version is available on NBE\\\\'s website to the public.\\\\nGOVERNANCE WILL BE APPROACHED AS FOLLOWS:\\\\n1. Concept of Banking Governance \\\\n2. NBE Governance\\\\n1. CONCEPT OF BANKING GOVERNANCE\\\\n1.1 DEFINITION\\\\nGovernance is a system of relationships between the bank management, the Board, shareholders \\\\nand the other stakeholders , setting a clear definition of powers and responsibilities for each of \\\\nthem. Governance tackles the method adopted by the bank\\\\'s Board and senior management to \\\\nguide and oversee its affairs and daily activities, including the following:\\\\n. 1Developing strategies and setting objectives.\\\\n. 2Defining the bank’s risk appetite.\\\\n. 3Handling the bank’s daily business activities.\\\\n. 4Maintaining balance between assuming responsibility towards shareholders and protecting the \\\\ninterests of depositors, taking into consideration other stakeholders\\\\' interests.1\\\\n1-  A stakeholder is any person having an interest of any type in NBE, including employees, customers, suppliers and creditors.\\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group4. 5Ensuring that the bank’s business activities are conducted safely and properly within the \\\\nframework of applicable laws controls.\\\\n. 6Following effective disclosure and transparency policies.\\\\nThe Bank for International Settlements, under whose supervision Basel Committee on Banking \\\\nSupervision operates, defines banking governance as the methods by which the bank\\\\'s Board and \\\\nsenior management direct the bank. Such methods determine how to set the bank\\\\'s objectives and \\\\nstrategies and the means of achieving such objectives. Governance also ensures ongoing evaluation \\\\nof performance and compliance with the laws, regulations and banking norms in order to protect \\\\nthe interests of depositors, shareholders and stakeholders. The system of governance is the \\\\nframework which determines the appropriate distribution of powers and responsibilities and the \\\\nfoundations of decision-making.\\\\n1.2 BENEFITS OF GOVERNANCE\\\\nDeveloping an effective governance system is of paramount importance to ensure the proper \\\\nfunctioning of the banking sector and the economy as a whole. Banks play a vital role in supporting \\\\nthe national economy by injecting funds into businesses and projects which drive economic \\\\ngrowth. How banks are managed is key to financial stability which is critical for maintaining a \\\\nhealthy national economy. Weak governance systems in systemically important banks could cause \\\\ncontagion of crises to the banking sector and the economy at large.\\\\nBank governance deals with developing policies to enhance management productivity. It ensures \\\\nefficient application of regulatory rules and laws together with the elevation of the bank’s financial \\\\nperformance indicators within a proper organizational framework for the bank\\\\'s operations and \\\\npolicies. This would ensure accuracy in assigning responsibilities, control, performance evaluation \\\\nand the availability of personnel capable of perceiving such strategic role.\\\\nMoreover, governance is the best method that empowers managers to direct and enhance \\\\ncorporate performance. The best Board is the one which believes that maintaining an outstanding \\\\nperformance stems from maintaining the balance between wealth creation and control, promoting \\\\nthe highest standards in both areas.\\\\n2. NBE GOVERNANCE\\\\nNBE, an Egyptian joint stock company (S.A.E), was established on June 25,1898. It became a \\\\nstate-owned public entity by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 40 of 1960. It was subsequently \\\\nturned into an Egyptian joint stock company by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 44 of 1961. It is \\\\ncurrently a fully state-owned bank in the form of an Egyptian joint stock company which is subject \\\\nto the provisions of CBE and the Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020. NBE undertakes all banking \\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group5activities performed by commercial banks in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations \\\\ngoverning such activities; the salient of which are:\\\\n. 1Accepting deposits, opening current accounts, procuring all forms of finance from Egypt \\\\nand abroad, and extending finance and credit facilities for different terms whether against \\\\nguarantees of different types or free of guarantees.\\\\n. 2Issuing shares and bonds, raising and accepting public subscriptions, and carrying out all the \\\\nactivities related to securities pursuant to the provisions of applicable laws and regulations.\\\\n. 3Handling collection and payment of orders, warrants and other papers of value.\\\\n. 4Issuing bonds, bills, cheques and notes whether payable in Egypt or abroad, except for bearer \\\\nbonds on demand, as well as discounting and negotiating bills, cheques and promissory notes of \\\\nany type whether payable in Egypt or abroad.\\\\n. 5Purchasing and selling securities at the Stock Exchange for its own account or on behalf of \\\\nothers.\\\\n. 6Providing custodian services in all forms and carrying out all securities-related activities.\\\\n. 7Making investments in corporations’ capital and taking part in establishing investment \\\\ncompanies and associations of capital.\\\\n. 8Dealing in financial derivatives to secure NBE and its customers against fluctuations in \\\\nexchange and interest rates in accordance with the rules and regulations of the CBE.\\\\n. 9Providing safe deposit box services.\\\\n. 10 Acting as an investment trustee for others.\\\\n. 11 Representing different banking entities.\\\\n. 12 Engaging in foreign exchange activities.\\\\n. 13 Doing the business of mutual funds, financial leasing, and real estate finance in accordance \\\\nwith CBE\\\\'s regulations.\\\\n. 14 Undertaking other necessary banking activities. In general, NBE carries out all banking, \\\\ncommercial and investment activities for the benefit of NBE or others or in participation with \\\\nother entities. In addition, NBE performs all other standard banking activities. NBE may, in \\\\nall respects, have interest in, partner with, purchase, affiliate to or merge under other banks, \\\\ncompanies, entities or bodies that conduct similar business or help NBE fulfill its purposes, \\\\nwhether in Egypt or abroad pursuant to the relevant governing laws and regulations.\\\\nNBE attaches great importance to sound governance practices. NBE\\\\'s Board applies the highest \\\\nprofessional performance standards to its all activities. In this regard, NBE complies with the Law of \\\\nthe Central Bank and Banking Sector promulgated under Law No. 194 of 2020, CBE’s instructions \\\\nand the best international practices. \\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group6GOVERNANCE AT NBE IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES:\\\\n. 1Treatment of all stakeholders on the same basis.\\\\n. 2Transparency and disclosure to allow the relevant parties to evaluate NBE\\\\'s performance and \\\\nfinancial position.\\\\n. 3Balanced relationship between NBE\\\\'s management and the Board, as well as among the Board, \\\\nshareholders and other stakeholders.\\\\n. 4Responsibility and accountability by clear segregation of duties.\\\\n. 5Good example, as the conduct and behaviour of Board members give a good example for all \\\\nNBE\\\\'s management levels.\\\\n. 6Developing a Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management, explaining the work \\\\nphilosophy adopted by management.\\\\n. 7Introduction of the Whistleblowing and Whistle-blower Protection Policy.\\\\n. 8Designing and applying the conflict of interest policy.\\\\n. 9Social and environmental responsibility.\\\\nNBE is a pioneer in adhering to governance concepts. This is crystallized by how the Board and \\\\nsenior management direct and oversee NBE\\\\'s business and daily activities, which affects the \\\\nprocess of setting objectives and shouldering responsibility towards all stakeholders such as \\\\nbeneficiaries, depositors, regulatory bodies, and governments. NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management \\\\nalso do business and act professionally in a way that ensures doing business safely and properly in \\\\ncompliance with the laws and regulations applicable to NBE.\\\\n3.  NBE\\\\'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOD)\\\\nThe Board is fully responsible for governance, starting from inculcating the culture of governance \\\\nand approving a Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management that will serve as a guide \\\\nfor performing their daily duties, up to taking the necessary steps to communicate the objectives \\\\nand conduct that should be followed at NBE. At the same time, the best interest of all stakeholders \\\\nshould be protected. The Board also approves the standards and values which reflect NBE\\\\'s \\\\npolicies that should be followed by all employees, senior management and directors. This comprises \\\\nNBE\\\\'s strategies. In addition, the Board sets general objectives for executive officers and oversees \\\\nthe realization of such objectives. Furthermore, the Board verifies the effectiveness of internal \\\\ncontrols and risk management to ensure maintaining NBE\\\\'s reputation.\\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group73.1 BOARD COMPOSITION\\\\nThe Bank is managed by a Board that comprises a number of directors having diverse experience \\\\nand appointed by the Prime Minister\\\\'s decision, subject to the CBE\\\\'s current governance \\\\ninstructions, provided that the majority of the Board consists of non-executive members.  \\\\nThe salaries, allowances and remuneration of the Chairman and Board directors shall be \\\\ndetermined by the General Assembly.\\\\n3.2 NON-EXECUTIVE AND INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\\\\nNBE applies and practices governance, and ensures the presence of effective audit and budgeting \\\\nfunctions, allowing objective feedback on NBE\\\\'s activities and the decisions made by the Board. \\\\nThis can be achieved through maintaining the balance, independence and objectivity of its Board \\\\nby engaging both executive and non-executive directors who shall have the skills and experience \\\\nthat qualify each of them to express his/her opinion during the Board\\\\'s discussions independently, \\\\nresulting in proper decision-making.\\\\nNon-executive directors are those who are not full-time employees at NBE, do not receive any \\\\nmonthly or annual salary from NBE, and do not provide any paid consultancy. The Board discloses \\\\nin its annual report the names of all non-executive directors who are deemed independent from \\\\nmanagement and do not have any kind of relationship that may prejudice their objectivity in \\\\ndecision-making.\\\\nA NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS DEEMED INDEPENDENT IF S/HE:\\\\n. 1is not a former employee of, nor have a family relationship with any of the employees of, the \\\\nBank or any of its affiliated parties during the three years preceding nomination.\\\\n. 2does not have any personal interests or any relevant relations with NBE.\\\\n. 3does not have family relations with directors, senior management member or any of their \\\\nrelatives up to fourth degree.\\\\n. 4receives compensation only in the form of allowances for his/her representation in the Board \\\\nand Board committees.\\\\n. 5is not a major shareholder in NBE and does not represent it.\\\\n. 6is not a partner or employee of NBE\\\\'s external auditor during the last three years prior to the \\\\ndate of his/her nomination as director.\\\\n. 7has not been a director for more than six successive years.2\\\\n2-    This is according to the provisions of Articles 118 ,120, and 134 of the CBE and the Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020.\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group83.3 BOARD’S RESPONSIBILITIES\\\\nThe Board is mainly responsible for the management of NBE as well as identifying and achieving \\\\nthe strategic objectives of the Bank.

The Board of Directors \\\\nplays a significant role in direction and leadership, while the role of senior management is to \\\\nprepare and implement the relevant strategies and policies developed and approved by the Board. \\\\nMoreover, the Board and its members should act independently from senior management. There \\\\nshould be no relationships which may affect the objectivity of decision taking.\\\\nThe Board ensures that senior management actively applies the policies preventing and minimizing \\\\nthe activities, relationships or circumstances which may jeopardize NBE\\\\'s governance system. These \\\\ninclude, for example, conflict of interests, internal lending and preferential treatment for related \\\\nparties or certain institutions (e.g. soft-term loans which are not granted to other NBE customers, \\\\nwithout deviating from banking norms). Both the Board and senior management should understand \\\\nNBE\\\\'s organizational structure and transaction volume. \\\\nFurthermore, NBE has in place an organizational chart and a manual of instructions which clearly \\\\nstate the powers and responsibilities across the Bank. The manual includes the most important \\\\nbusiness procedures and the duties of NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management. Both the Board and \\\\nsenior management undertake the responsibility of instituting and underpinning professional and \\\\nethical standards, besides enhancing internal control culture. NBE shall design certain policies \\\\ncovering practices relating to such standards, ensuring the compliance of its staff with such policies.\\\\nNBE applies the principle of dual control. More than one person should jointly take vital decisions \\\\nto ensure objectivity and avoid conflict of interests. Senior management verifies that the relevant \\\\npolicies and strategies have been properly communicated to all NBE\\\\'s staff. In the meantime, the \\\\nBoard oversees senior management\\\\'s activities and assesses how far they are in compliance with \\\\nBoard\\\\'s policies. This is an essential part of checks and balances which should be available in an \\\\neffective governance system.\\\\nNBE sets appropriate supervisory positions in its organizational chart able to assume their \\\\nrespective responsibilities, in order to ensure effective supervision and control over all job levels \\\\nwhile accurately describing the authorities and responsibilities of each level, including: \\\\n. 1directors, in their capacity as members in the Board and its committees.\\\\n. 2senior managers.\\\\n. 3NBE’s functions of day-to-day work.\\\\n. 4heads of groups who directly oversee NBE\\\\'s various divisions.\\\\n. 5heads of NBE\\\\'s various divisions.\\\\n. 6NBE\\\\'s independent functions, such as Risk, Compliance, and Internal Audit and Inspection \\\\nGroups.\\\\n--- Page 23 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group22In addition, it is important to check that the right person is in the right place, to ensure that duties \\\\nare fully discharged. \\\\nBoard and senior management shall perform their duties according to the following \\\\nprinciples:\\\\n. 1Comply to the Central Bank and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020 and regulations and \\\\ninstructions issued as a result;\\\\n. 2Exert due diligence as per technical and professional customs.\\\\n. 3Collaborate with the Central Bank with credibility and transparency.\\\\n. 4Notify the Central Bank of any grave violations in the Bank.\\\\n. 5Verify that their duties are performed efficiently and effectively according to the applicable laws \\\\nand regulations. \\\\n. 6Ensure that their responsibilities are assigned to persons having the competency and authority \\\\nnecessary to perform the assigned duties, while assuming full responsibility for these duties. \\\\n. 7Exercise all due diligence to protect the interests of customers, providing them with fair \\\\ntreatment.\\\\n. 8Maintain disclosure and transparency upon providing information requisite for customers.\\\\n. 9Avoid any conflict of interest. \\\\n6. INTERNAL CONTROL\\\\n6.1 DEFINITION\\\\nInternal control is a process whereby all the Bank\\\\'s activities and operations are regularly \\\\nmonitored and reviewed by the Board, senior management, all NBE\\\\'s committees and employees \\\\nacting as part of the Bank\\\\'s internal control function.4\\\\n4-Pursuant to Article 121 of the Law of the Central Bank and the Banking Sector promulgated under Law No. 194 of 2020\\\\n--- Page 24 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group236.2 CULTURE\\\\nThe Board and senior management are responsible for setting and communicating the standards \\\\nnecessary for fostering internal control culture and establishing the control environment at the \\\\nvarious levels of management at the Bank, which makes all employees at all levels aware of the \\\\nnature of their respective roles and responsibilities in light of the Bank\\\\'s approved policy. The \\\\npolicies of the Bank and the Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management should reflect \\\\nthe ethical values of the Bank and/or the overall banking group, with the objective of reducing any \\\\nbreaches or abuses committed by the staff, which may cause financial and moral losses to the Bank.   \\\\n6.3 OBJECTIVES\\\\n. 1Ensure the efficiency of activities and operations management at the Bank in order to optimally \\\\nutilize resources and manage assets to avoid losses and maximize profits.\\\\n. 2Check consistency and compliance of the Bank\\\\'s activities and operations with a pplicable laws \\\\nand control rules, and their conformity with policies, procedures and bylaws of the Bank.\\\\n. 3Ensure the efficiency of risk management function and follow adequate procedures to control \\\\nand reduce risk.\\\\n. 4Verify the effectiveness of management information systems (MIS) to support timely decision-\\\\nmaking as well as adequate and accurate reporting.\\\\n6.4 NBE\\\\'S INTERNAL CONTROL ELEMENTS\\\\nThe integration of internal control elements is the cornerstone of success in achieving its \\\\nobjectives, especially regarding the protection of NBE\\\\'s assets against risks and the achievement of \\\\nthe relevant strategic objectives, according to the following:\\\\n. 1The effective role of the Bank\\\\'s Board and senior management;\\\\n. 2Consistency and effectiveness of internal control functions (Internal Audit and Inspection - Risk \\\\nManagement - Compliance).\\\\n. 3Adequacy of risk control systems.\\\\n. 4Efficiency of information systems and communication channels of the Bank.\\\\n. 5Efficiency of the adopted internal control procedures to ensure dual control and segregation of \\\\nduties.\\\\n. 6Review of internal control policies and procedures, periodical assessment of their effectiveness, \\\\nand adoption of the necessary corrective measures in this regard.\\\\n--- Page 25 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group24The organizational structure of the internal control functions is reviewed at least once annually by \\\\ninternal and external auditors.\\\\n6.5 BOARD\\\\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITORS AND OTHER \\\\nINTERNAL CONTROL FUNCTIONS\\\\nT o ensure having an effective governance system, cooperation is maintained between the Bank\\\\'s \\\\nBoard and the internal and external auditors in addition to NBE\\\\'s internal control functions \\\\n(Risk Group, Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group, and Internal Audit and \\\\nInspection Group). The Board and senior management shall make the best use of the deliverables \\\\nof the Bank\\\\'s Risk Group, Internal Audit & Inspection Group and Regulatory Compliance & \\\\nCorporate Governance Group as well as external auditors\\\\' notes and reports, in order to verify \\\\nthe information disclosed by the management regarding the validity of the Bank\\\\'s operations and \\\\nperformance.\\\\nOptimal use of the recommendations and comments of the departments/groups referred to above \\\\nhelps to verify the information disclosed by the management regarding the validity of the Bank\\\\'s \\\\noperations and performance.\\\\nWhen modifying its organizational structure, the Bank has observed the segregation of duties \\\\nof the departments/groups exposed to risk and the departments/groups monitoring such risk. \\\\nMoreover, the Bank\\\\'s existing committees are reorganized to avoid any conflict of interests and \\\\nwork independently. Direct contact should be maintained between each of the aforementioned \\\\nfunctions and the Bank\\\\'s Board and senior management. The Bank\\\\'s Board and senior management \\\\nare responsible for ensuring the availability of sufficient resources for internal control functions \\\\n(Risk, Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance and Internal Audit and Inspection) in \\\\naddition to hiring skilled and experienced employees in such departments to adequately meet \\\\ntheir needs and support these Groups to have readily available access to important reports and \\\\ninformation from different NBE divisions and branches\\\\n6.6 INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION (INTERNAL AUDIT AND INSPECTION GROUP)  \\\\nThe importance of internal audit function stems from ensuring the effectiveness and adequacy \\\\nof NBE\\\\'s internal controls and governance to provide a comprehensive insight to the Audit \\\\nCommittee, the senior management and Board on internal control and governance. In addition, \\\\nthe internal audit evaluates the efficiency and adequacy of the procedures adopted by the Bank\\\\'s \\\\ndifferent departments and business lines.\\\\nThe internal audit function is completely independent of other activities being reviewed, which is \\\\nreflected in the Bank\\\\'s organizational structure and the powers vested to it. This enables its staff to \\\\nfulfill the assigned tasks with full objectivity and impartiality. The internal audit department reports \\\\n--- Page 26 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group25directly to the Audit Committee, which submits its reports to the Board to ensure independence.\\\\nThe Bank shall develop an Audit Charter, which will be reviewed and updated periodically. The \\\\nCharter generally includes the objectives of the audit function and the tasks assigned to the Audit \\\\nDepartment and clearly identifies the powers and responsibilities of its staff.\\\\nPursuant to the provisions of Article ( 120) of the Central Bank and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of \\\\n2020 and the CBE’s internal control instructions dated September 2,2014, banks are committed to \\\\nobtain the CBE\\\\'s approval of the appointment of the Head/Director of Internal Audit in accordance \\\\nwith the relevant rules. Moreover, the Board shall approve the decision of resignation or removal \\\\nof the Internal Audit and Inspection Group Head for any reason, provided that removal reasons are \\\\ndisclosed and discussed with CBE.\\\\n6.6.1 MAIN FUNCTIONS OF INTERNAL AUDIT\\\\n1. Evaluate the adequacy of internal control systems approved by NBE\\\\'s senior management, \\\\nensure that appropriate review and continuous development and update of internal \\\\ncontrols, risk management procedures and compliance systems are properly carried out \\\\nin all NBE\\\\'s units and branches inside Egypt and abroad, report remarks and corrective \\\\nmeasures to the Audit Committee and/or the Board, and follow up the implementation of \\\\nthe relevant corrective measures.\\\\n2. Evaluate the compliance of NBE\\\\'s various activities and business units with the adopted \\\\nprocedures and policies.\\\\n3. Assess the effectiveness of the applicable procedures and policies and their consistency \\\\nwith business and market developments.\\\\n4. Follow-up the feedback and proposals reported by Internal Audit and Inspection Group \\\\nthrough the Manager of Audit and Inspection Follow-up Department with a view to \\\\nensuring that such feedback is sound and can consequently be reported. NBE\\\\'s Board and \\\\nsenior management will verify the significance of the feedback made by the Internal Audit \\\\nand Inspection Group, particularly such matters related to risk management and internal \\\\ncontrols through the following procedures:\\\\n4.1 continuously stressing the importance of internal audit and control functions and \\\\ncommunicating this vision to all NBE\\\\'s units to make sure that all NBE\\\\'s employees are \\\\naware of the importance and impact of such functions in the Bank.\\\\n4.2 timely and effectively making optimal use of the feedback made by the Internal Audit and \\\\nInspection Group; meanwhile, the senior management shall take the appropriate corrective \\\\nmeasures in time.\\\\n4.3 encouraging and enhancing the independence of internal auditors when conducting their \\\\naudit via the Bank\\\\'s organizational structure and the vested powers, which facilitates \\\\ndirect communication channels and direct reporting to Audit Committee for subsequent \\\\npresentation to the Board to ensure independence. This enhances their competencies \\\\n--- Page 27 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group26when discharging their duties with full objectivity and impartiality and encourages \\\\ntheir participation in judging the effectiveness of the Bank\\\\'s internal controls and risk \\\\nmanagement. It is also necessary to ensure that there is an easy access to important \\\\nreports and information from all NBE\\\\'s divisions.\\\\n5. Develop an annual internal audit plan that defines the minimum scope and frequency of the \\\\naudit and covers CBE\\\\'s instructions, to be approved by the Audit Committee.\\\\n6.6.2 INTERNAL AUDIT RELATIONSHIP WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES\\\\n CENTRAL BANK OF EGYPT:\\\\n. 1NBE\\\\'s management should maintain a communication channel between the Head of the \\\\nInternal Audit and Inspection Group and the CBE’s Control and Supervision Sector, to discuss \\\\nthe measures taken on the weaknesses and the Bank\\\\'s ways to address them.\\\\n. 2According to the instructions issued on governance, the Audit Committee should provide the \\\\nControl and Supervision Sector with a quarterly report to be discussed with the Board; and \\\\nidentify the corrective measures to be taken on a timely basis.\\\\n. 3The Bank\\\\'s management should notify the Control and Supervision Sector of the decisions, \\\\nfacts and developments that significantly affect its financial position, particularly the issues \\\\nthat require holding meetings between the Bank and the external auditors or the relevant \\\\nregulatory authorities. In the light of such information, the CBE shall consider participation in \\\\nsuch meetings.\\\\nEXTERNAL AUDITORS:\\\\n. 1The Internal Audit and Inspection Group should coordinate with the external auditors \\\\nespecially when holding discussions with the senior management, Board and Audit Committee \\\\non the recommendations about developing Internal Control in the light of Article 125 of the \\\\nCBE and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020.\\\\n. 2The Internal Audit and Inspection Group shall provide the external auditor with the necessary \\\\ninternal audit reports, highlighting key issues raised by the internal auditors that may be \\\\nimportant to the CBE.\\\\n. 3Efforts of internal audit and external auditors shall be coordinated and effective \\\\ncommunication channels are to be established to discuss risk-related activities, identified \\\\nweaknesses as well as the relevant procedures taken, and to understand risk management \\\\nstrategies adopted by the Bank.\\\\n6.6.3 AUDITING NBE\\\\'S FOREIGN BRANCHES & UNITS\\\\nNBE takes certain regulatory measures regarding its foreign branches and units \\\\nensuring that:\\\\n--- Page 28 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group27. 1The business activities of foreign units are consistent with the organizational and strategic \\\\nobjectives of NBE\\\\'s or the Group as a whole.\\\\n. 2All foreign units and branches comply with the applicable instructions at the host country \\\\nin addition to adhering to CBE instructions, particularly with regard to the rules of the \\\\npreparation and presentation of financial statements. In case of inconsistency, NBE\\\\'s foreign \\\\nunit/branch should notify the Head of Compliance and Corporate Go vernance Group- Head \\\\nOffice who, in turn, should notify CBE\\\\'s Control & Supervision Sector adequately to take the \\\\nnecessary action.\\\\n. 3Decision-making authorities are in line with the targets of the units and their operational \\\\ndivisions.\\\\n. 4Duties are segregated and the principle of dual control is effectively applied.\\\\n. 5Foreign units perform internal audit and send periodic reports thereon to the Bank\\\\'s H/O \\\\nAudit Department or the Group.\\\\n. 6The CBE’s Control and Supervision Sector is informed of all audit reports prepared on NBE’s \\\\nforeign branches and units by the host country\\\\'s regulatory authorities or auditors. \\\\n6.7 COMPLIANCE FUNCTION (REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND CORPORATE \\\\nGOVERNANCE GROUP)\\\\nThe compliance function is intended to establish and deepen effective, advanced and firm control \\\\npolicies, systems and tools to ensure NBE\\\\'s compliance with the existing rules according to the \\\\napplicable legislation and regulatory instructions at the local and international levels. This enables \\\\nthe Bank to face and control any potential risks of using NBE for illegal or suspicious purposes, \\\\nparticularly financial crimes including money laundering activities. NBE should, therefore, be well-\\\\naware of non-compliance risks. Such risks may include financial loss, legal or regulatory sanctions \\\\nand/or impaired reputation of the Bank, as a result of failure to comply with the applicable laws \\\\nor the rules and regulations issued by regulatory bodies inside Egypt and abroad. Accordingly, the \\\\nresponsibility for maintaining the Bank\\\\'s good reputation does not fall upon the Compliance Group \\\\nsolely; rather it is the responsibility of all NBE\\\\'s employees.\\\\nNBE\\\\'s senior management is responsible for devising Board-approved policies on the compliance \\\\nfunction and communicating them to all NBE\\\\'s staff.\\\\nThe Compliance Officer shall be independent, directly reporting to the Audit Committee and/or \\\\nthe Board.\\\\nCBE\\\\'s approval is to be obtained with regard to the appointment of the Compliance Officer \\\\nin accordance with the relevant regulatory instructions. Moreover, the Board shall approve the \\\\ndecision of resignation or removal of the Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance \\\\n--- Page 29 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group28Group Head for any reason whatsoever, provided that removal reasons are disclosed and discussed \\\\nwith CBE.\\\\n6.7.1 MAIN FUNCTIONS OF COMPLIANCE GROUP\\\\n1.Review the activities related to maintaining a database of laws and regulations issued by CBE in  \\\\n   addition to communicating the relevant information promptly to the parties concerned through  \\\\n   the following:\\\\n1.1maintaining a database of laws and regulations related to the banking business to be able to     \\\\n     review NBE’s policies and work procedures.\\\\n1.2supervising the revision of the Bank\\\\'s documents and forms in use and ensuring their  \\\\n     compliance with the applicable laws and regulations in addition to making the necessary  \\\\n     recommendations.\\\\n1.3coordinating with all divisions to ensure the adequacy of the applicable controls in the  \\\\n     performance of their transactions and tasks pursuant to the relevant laws and regulations and  \\\\n     measuring the effectiveness of such control in light of the application of a risk-based approach. \\\\n2.Proactively identify, evaluate and document the non-compliance risks associated with the Bank\\\\'s  \\\\n    activities and business.\\\\n3.Identify and prioritize the geographic regions and products which may be subject to non-  \\\\n    compliance risks that may jeopardize the Bank\\\\'s reputation or expose the Bank to legal or  \\\\n    regulatory sanctions or to financial loss.\\\\n4.Appropriately and timely incorporate the applicable laws and regulations and amendments  \\\\n    thereto into the Bank\\\\'s policies and procedures.\\\\n5.Review all instructions and correspondence sent from CBE and other regulatory authorities  \\\\n    addressed to the Compliance Group by the Chairman.\\\\n6.Examine new products to ensure their compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements  \\\\n     and controls.

In addition, the  \\\\n    Compliance Group shall work on preparing a plan to assess and audit the work of compliance,  \\\\n    covering all aspects of the Bank\\\\'s activities. This process is considered one of the audit tools and  \\\\n    techniques applied by the Compliance Group to help in planning, identifying priorities,  \\\\n     determining breaches, gaps and accomplishments/ recommendations and reaching an  \\\\n     agreement on the appropriate corrective measures with the relevant divisions.\\\\n14.Periodically and regularly assess the regulatory compliance, anti-money laundering (AML)  \\\\n     and/or counter finance of terrorism (CFT) procedures to examine the effectiveness of such  \\\\n     procedures and verify the application of the appropriate techniques to face the risks;\\\\n15.Evaluate several areas including managing conflict of interest and deliberate breaches, violating  \\\\n    instructions and laws, treating customers fairly and ensuring the suitability of customer advice  \\\\n     and disclosure.  \\\\n16.Act as a focal point with the regulatory authorities in obtaining any amendments to the  \\\\n     controls, approvals and exceptions and provide such regulatory authorities with the  \\\\n     compliance-related data, information and periodical reports.\\\\n17.Revise all compliance-related remarks in the reports of regulatory authorities and forward such  \\\\n    remarks to the competent divisions to take the necessary corrective measures and reply to the  \\\\n    remarks.\\\\n6.7.2 COMPLIANCE GROUP\\\\'S ROLE AS REGARDS FOREIGN BRANCHES AND SUBSIDIARIES:\\\\n. 1Ensure maintaining effective communication with NBE\\\\'s foreign branches and subsidiaries to \\\\nconfirm their compliance with the local and international policies and pr ocedures. The Group \\\\nshall receive periodical compliance assessment report from foreign branches, to follow up the \\\\nperformance of evaluation and give instructions concerning the corrective measures to be \\\\ntaken, if necessary. Moreover, Compliance Group shall consider any conflict between local laws \\\\nand instructions and those applicable at the host country and report the same to the CBE\\\\'s \\\\nControl and Supervision Sector to prepare a memorandum of understanding (\\\"MoU\\\") in this \\\\nregard with the host authorities, if necessary.\\\\n. 2Continuously monitor the compliance of NBE\\\\'s foreign branches and subsidiaries with the \\\\nlocal and international policies, procedures, controls and laws.\\\\n. 3Evaluate and monitor the compliance of foreign branches and subsidiaries to ensure that \\\\ncompliance programs are strictly applied.\\\\n--- Page 31 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group30. 4Coordinate with foreign branches for ongoing control to spot breaches/ deficiencies with \\\\nregard to compliance with regulatory controls and propose corrective measures.\\\\n. 5Identify the deficiencies in the application of compliance program at NBE\\\\'s branches and units \\\\nand take the necessary corrective measures.\\\\n. 6Review the compliance periodic reports received from foreign branches and subsidiaries.\\\\n. 7Review internal and external audit reports on compliance and monitor the corrective \\\\nmeasures to be taken.\\\\n6.8 RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION (RISK GROUP)\\\\nNBE has a clear organizational structure that includes an independent function which is responsible \\\\nfor risk management and clearly identifies the persons to be accountable for risk management \\\\nalong with their duties and responsibilities, particularly the authorities and duties of Risk Group \\\\nHead. It is essential to apply the segregation of duties principle to avoid any conflict of interests, \\\\nwhile maintaining direct contact between Risk Management Group and the Risk Committee \\\\nand the Board. It also emphasizes that the Head of Risk Group shall not undertake any financial \\\\nor management responsibilities that might conflict with his/her position as Risk Group Head. \\\\nAdditionally, the non-executive directors should be keen on meeting with the Risk Group Head on \\\\na regular basis in the absence of executive directors.\\\\nThe appointment of the Risk Group Head shall be subject to the CBE\\\\'s approval. Moreover, the \\\\nBoard shall approve the respective decision of resignation or removal of the Risk Group Head for \\\\nany reason, provided that removal reasons are disclosed and discussed with CBE in accordance \\\\nwith the relevant regulatory instructions.\\\\n6.8.1 MAIN FUNCTIONS OF RISK MANAGEMENT\\\\n. 1Analyze potential risks, mainly credit, market and operational risks, while ensuring that the said \\\\nanalysis is accurately and timely performed.\\\\n. 2Identify a specific work flow for risk measurement, monitoring, and control, ensuring that \\\\napproved contingency plans are put in place (business continuity plan (BCP), liquidity plan, etc.).\\\\n. 3Continuously gauge the adequacy and effectiveness of the work flow for risk measurement, \\\\nmonitoring, and control; and make any relevant amendments, if necessary, according to the \\\\ndevelopments in the market and the changes in NBE\\\\'s work environment.\\\\n. 4The policies approved by the Board should contain acceptable risk exposures which will be \\\\nreviewed and evaluated periodically by the Risk Committee and the Board. Such exposures \\\\nshould be consistent with NBE\\\\'s risk appetite and capital amount, taking into account \\\\nrisk measurement and management in the Bank in general. Appropriate actions shall be \\\\ntaken in case of any deviations from the relevant policies. Additionally, there should be \\\\nseparate departments/divisions for each type of major risks (e.g. credit risk including retail \\\\n--- Page 32 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group31banking, market, operational risks, etc.) reporting to Risk Group, with defined authorities, \\\\nresponsibilities and duties. The segregation of duties between regulatory and executive \\\\nfunctions is essential to avoid conflict of interests.\\\\n. 5NBE should have a proper and effective information flow and communication system that \\\\nbetter serves risk monitoring and control. NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management, as well as Risk \\\\nCommittee, should be timely provided with proper information and periodic reports, at least \\\\non a quarterly basis, that reflect NBE\\\\'s compliance with acceptable risk exposures, as well as \\\\nthe reports that indicate non-compliance with such acceptable risk exposures, detailing the \\\\nreasons and the corrective measures.\\\\n. 6 NBE should have in place an effective risk control and analysis system, taking into account \\\\nthe nature of its business activity and the volume of its transactions, in order to assess different \\\\ntypes of risk. Such system should include:  \\\\n6.1 identifying all types of risks whether quantitatively measurable or unmeasurable, and \\\\ndefining internal and external risk elements.  \\\\n6.2 having in place a risk management framework which comprises evaluation forms, approved \\\\nrisk limits and the bases for monitoring risk. Such forms should be regularly reviewed and \\\\ndeveloped. \\\\n6.3 regularly reviewing NBE’s total risk matrix, particularly credit (corporate and retail) risk, \\\\nmarket risk and operational risk.  \\\\n6.4 regularly following-up and evaluating the system to ensure that NBE’s internal risk \\\\nmanagement procedures are in line with market conditions and to develop the appropriate \\\\nbanking prudential standards.\\\\n. 7Risk management policies should include a specific stress testing mechanism as one of the \\\\ntools used by the Bank\\\\'s risk management. This mechanism should be developed specifically \\\\nand clearly, particularly with respect to the frequency and conditions under which testing is \\\\ncarried out, the utilized methods, the appropriate risk assumptions and factors, time periods, \\\\ndifferent scenarios for all types of risk including worst case scenarios, and the scope of testing. \\\\nDocumenting procedures should be determined and quarterly reports presented to the senior \\\\nmanagement, Risk Committee and the Board which should, in turn, evaluate the delivered \\\\nfindings and take the necessary prudential procedures or decisions in this regard. \\\\n. 8The Group should provide early warning indicators to help identify and manage factors related \\\\nto major risks. \\\\n. 9Management reports are to be presented in a clear and understandable manner which enables \\\\nNBE\\\\'s directors to evaluate the reported risks and take the appropriate decisions in this \\\\nregard, particularly in relation to the results of stress tests.  \\\\n--- Page 33 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group327. EXTERNAL AUDITOR\\\\nThe external auditor function is important as it provides confirmation and assurances to the Board \\\\nthat the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations \\\\nand the Egyptian and international reporting standards and accurately represent the Bank\\\\'s financial \\\\nposition and performance with regard to all financial aspects.\\\\nThe external auditor must comply with the highest professional standards. The approval of \\\\nthe Audit Committee should be obtained prior to contracting an external auditor to provide \\\\nconsultancy or services other than auditing the Bank’s financial statements. The external auditor \\\\nshould be completely independent of the Bank\\\\'s functions and directors to avoid any conflict of \\\\ninterests.\\\\nThe appointment and/ or removal of the external auditor shall be subject to the recommendation \\\\nof the Audit Committee. Such recommendation shall be submitted to the general assembly to take \\\\nits decision with respect to approving the appointment and/ or removal of the external auditor.\\\\n7.1 BOARD\\\\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL AUDITOR\\\\nNBE\\\\'s Board ensures that there is direct contact between the external auditors and the Audit \\\\nCommittee to which they will directly report.\\\\nThe Audit Committee plays an effective and important role with respect to the relationship with \\\\nexternal auditors by supervising their work and directly contacting them. The Audit Committee \\\\nassumes direct responsibility for the following:\\\\n. 1Nominate and/ or remove, and determine the fees and remuneration of, external auditors.\\\\n. 2Approve the scope of the audit to be performed with external auditors.\\\\n. 3Receive audit reports and ensure that NBE\\\\'s management takes the necessary corrective \\\\nmeasures in time in relation to the problems identified by external auditors, other internal \\\\ncontrol deficiencies and weaknesses and non-compliance with the approved policies and \\\\napplicable laws.\\\\nBoth NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management contribute to enhancing external auditors\\\\' role and \\\\nensuring that the financial statements reflect NBE\\\\'s sound performance in all important aspects \\\\nand show NBE\\\\'s real financial position. NBE\\\\'s Board and senior management can support external \\\\nauditors\\\\' role through ensuring that: \\\\n. 1External auditors comply with the currently applicable professional practices and standards.\\\\n. 2Audit verifies NBE\\\\'s internal controls in relation to disclosure of the financial statements.\\\\n--- Page 34 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group33. 3External auditors understand and are fully aware of their liabilities towards the Bank, especially \\\\npracticing due diligence to complete the audit process.\\\\n. 4Non-executive directors hold meetings with the external auditors (excluding senior \\\\nmanagement) in the presence of the heads of the Internal Audit and Inspection Group and \\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group, at least once a year.\\\\n8. DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY\\\\nHaving in place a mechanism for disclosure and transparency strengthens the efficiency and \\\\nviability of NBE’s business. Keen on the application of professional transparency and disclosure \\\\nstandards, NBE ensures accurate, full and timely disclosure of all important financial and non-\\\\nfinancial information of the Bank, taking into account the volume and complexity of its operations, \\\\nownership structure and risk appetite. All NBE\\\\'s stakeholders have to be aware of the Bank\\\\'s \\\\nstrategies and have access to adequate information in order to evaluate its performance.\\\\nNBE provides many communication channels to exchange information such as: annual report, \\\\nreports to regulatory authorities and NBE’s website.\\\\n8. 1MAIN RULES OF TRANSPARENCY ADOPTED BY NBE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED \\\\nTO, DISCLOSURE OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION\\\\n. 1Structure and composition of NBE\\\\'s Board.\\\\n. 2Responsibilities, experience and qualifications of NBE\\\\'s Board.\\\\n. 3NBE\\\\'s ownership structure.\\\\n. 4NBE\\\\'s organizational structure; for example, overall organizational structure, business functions, \\\\naffiliated and associated companies and the Board\\\\'s committees and their responsibilities.\\\\n. 5Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management.\\\\n. 6NBE\\\\'s policies in relation to conflict of interests, insider transactions and dealings with affiliated \\\\nand associated parties.\\\\n. 7NBE\\\\'s policy on governance practices.\\\\n. 8NBE\\\\'s policies regarding employees\\\\' compensation and benefits, including directors\\\\' and senior \\\\nexecutives\\\\' remuneration, disclosing the total amount paid to the top twenty collectively \\\\n(including salaries, allowances, fringe benefits and any other cash benefits).\\\\n. 9Policy on NBE\\\\'s corporate social responsibility and related actions.\\\\n. 10 Disclosure of financial statements approved by the independent external auditor, and the \\\\nnotes to the accounts which show NBE\\\\'s financial performance and position according to the \\\\nCBE’s Rules of Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements and the relevant governing \\\\n--- Page 35 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group34laws and legislation; and \\\\n. 11 Disclosure of the effective interest rates and banking tariffs in accordance with Article No. \\\\n88 of the Law of Central Bank and Banking Sector promulgated under Law No. 194 of 2020 \\\\nand the relevant instructions issued by regulatory authorities.\\\\n. 12 Disclosure by directors about their representation/membership in BoDs of affiliated \\\\ncompanies/entities.\\\\n9. TIGHTENING CONTROL OVER THE COMPLEX \\\\nSTRUCTURES/TRANSACTIONS IN LINE WITH \\\\nGOVERNANCE PRACTICES\\\\nNBE is keen to avoid the unjustifiable legally-complex transactions that may jeopardize the \\\\nprinciple of transparency. The Bank also avoids involvement in vaguely structured transactions that \\\\ncurb the Board\\\\'s ability to effectively supervise such type of NBE\\\\'s business.\\\\nThe Bank\\\\'s Board is also keen on ensuring the full awareness and understanding of NBE\\\\'s \\\\nstructure, affiliated entities and related risks. NBE\\\\'s Board thoroughly perceives any prospective \\\\ncomplex transactions or products and ensued risks. Moreover, NBE realizes the necessity of \\\\nadopting clear policies and procedures to overcome such risks along with taking appropriate \\\\nmeasures to mitigate their consequences. This includes understanding the connection between \\\\nthese entities and the Bank, as well as the legal and operational risks related to this structure, \\\\nrelated-party transactions and the effect of these factors on NBE\\\\'s financing approach, capital, and \\\\nrisk level in both favorable or unfavorable circumstances and on the reputation of NBE\\\\'s Group \\\\nas a whole. Risks that may arise out of these complex structures/ transactions are controlled \\\\nthrough:\\\\n. 1Having in place a clear and documented centralized mechanism for approving and monitoring \\\\nstructures and when forming new affiliated legal entities.\\\\n. 2Periodically monitoring the appropriate application of the adopted policies, procedures and \\\\nlimits.\\\\n. 3Ensuring the consistency and adherence of such structures/ transactions to the laws and \\\\nregulatory controls to be followed by the Bank.\\\\n. 4Providing accurate information regarding the structure of the Bank as a whole in terms of \\\\ntype, characteristics, ownership structure and nature of activities, for each affiliated legal entity \\\\nseparately.\\\\n. 5Obtaining adequate information concerning such structures/ transactions and the associated \\\\nrisks and recognizing the risks that can be imposed by the complexity and overlapping \\\\nstructure of the Bank or the Group, including lack of transparency and operational risks \\\\nresulting from the complicated organizational structure particularly in legal terms, provided \\\\nthat they are reported to the Bank\\\\'s Board and disclosed to CBE. The disclosed information \\\\nshould include the purpose, amounts, strategies, risks of such transactions and the relevant \\\\n--- Page 36 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group35control mechanisms, ensuring that information regarding these transactions are properly \\\\ndisclosed.\\\\n. 6Internal audit officers of each affiliated entity shall regularly present a report to the Bank\\\\'s \\\\nAudit Committee evaluating the group structure-related risks, so that such complex \\\\nstructures/ transactions can be monitored and controlled. It is also necessary that periodic \\\\nreports containing the most significant feedback and deviations from the adopted policies and \\\\nprocedures shall be submitted to the Bank\\\\'s Board, Risk Committee and senior management.   \\\\n10. CODE OF ETHICS FOR NBE\\\\'S STAFF AND SENIOR \\\\nMANAGEMENT\\\\nThe Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management serves as a general statement clarifying \\\\nthe professional and ethical standards applicable in the Bank. All employees shall comply with all the \\\\ncontents of the Code of Ethics. The employee is fully responsible for its contents, as he/she signs \\\\nan acknowledgment of compliance with the Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management \\\\nbefore starting work. The Code of Ethics shall be regularly reviewed. Any amendments to this Code \\\\nwill be communicated to all employees who shall be given the appropriate training in this regard. \\\\n Any failure to abide by the instructions mentioned in the Code of Ethics is considered a serious \\\\nviolation and may expose the employee to disciplinary actions which may include the termination \\\\nof his/her employment. All employees should, therefore, comply with the contents of the Code. \\\\nRegardless of their locations and ranks, all NBE\\\\'s employees must immediately report to the Ethics \\\\nOfficer any violations resulting from behaviours or practices that are thought to be incorrect, \\\\ninappropriate or unethical according to the Whistleblowing and Whistle-blower Protection \\\\nPolicy. It should be known that any reports on actual or potential violations in the Bank will not \\\\nbe ignored. If the employee involved in these violations reported them, it would be taken into \\\\nconsideration during the investigations. The Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance \\\\nGroup shall coordinate with the Internal Audit and Inspection, Legal Affairs and HR Groups to take \\\\nthe necessary corrective measures according to the consequences of such violation.\\\\nThe Compliance Officer is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with all the local and \\\\ninternational regulatory instructions, as well as NBE’s internal policies and procedures.\\\\nThe Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group is responsible for regularly \\\\nreviewing and updating the Code of Ethics as well as ensuring its consistency with the Bank\\\\'s new \\\\npolicies and procedures and the relevant regulatory and legal changes.\\\\n--- Page 37 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group3611.  WHISTLEBLOWING AND WHISTLE-BLOWER \\\\nPROTECTION POLICY\\\\nNBE is keen to provide a sound and constructive working environment based on ethical values that \\\\nenhances integrity, accountability and transparency.\\\\nNBE\\\\'s Whistleblowing Policy aims at providing a safe channel for the employees so as to eliminate \\\\ntheir fears and to assure them that they will be protected against any retaliation or harm as a \\\\nresult of reporting any violations. The policy provides protection to whistle-blowers who report \\\\nany violations that do not comply with the Code of Ethics for NBE\\\\'s Staff and Senior Management.\\\\nThis policy accordingly assists senior management to unveil any corrupt or illegal behaviour, so that \\\\nthe necessary procedures can be taken. This will curb such violations and contribute to creating a \\\\nsound work environment that promotes employees\\\\' ethical values.\\\\n12. CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY:\\\\nConflict of interest is a situation in which an employee or one of his/her family members has a \\\\nmaterial or moral interest which conflicts with the employee’s position or job requirements such \\\\nas integrity, independence and protection of public money, or realizes illicit gain for the employee \\\\nor any third party. Any employee should disclose any such conflict to the Regulatory Compliance \\\\nand Corporate Governance Group to take the necessary actions to prevent the occurrence of any \\\\ndamage to the Bank.\\\\nConflict of interest occurs when employee\\\\'s own interest overlaps somehow with the Bank’s \\\\ninterest. Such conflict clearly emerges when the employee uses practices that serve the best \\\\ninterest of himself/herself, or one of his/her family members. This also happens when the employee \\\\ngives his/her acquaintances or relatives a privileged treatment over other customers by abusing his/\\\\nher position in the Bank, including, for instance, extending loans or reducing due commissions and \\\\ninterests in contradiction with the relevant instructions and controls.\\\\nConflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, the following; any other case of conflict \\\\nof interest which is not included below shall be reported to the Regulatory Compliance and \\\\nCorporate Governance Group Head:\\\\nDeals and transactions with external parties\\\\nEmployees or their relatives up to the second degree may not, directly or indirectly, purchase, sell, \\\\nlease out any property in favour of the Bank, or offer any outsourcing or supply services for the \\\\nBank\\\\'s requirements, unless there is no conflict of interest that may achieve direct benefit to the \\\\nemployee. Such transaction shall benefit the Bank and be arranged on a fair basis. \\\\n--- Page 38 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group37No employee may, personally or by proxy, apply to the Bank’s tenders or bids. The Bank shall not \\\\npurchase any items from, nor assign any business to, any employee. No employee may, personally or \\\\nby intermediary, enter any kind of auction unless the sold items will be purchased by employees for \\\\ntheir own usage and they are offered for sale by entities other than the Bank, which are not subject \\\\nto the Bank’s supervision. Notwithstanding the above, the Bank may approve otherwise.  \\\\nAny transaction between the Bank and any employee in which there is a personal gain to the \\\\nemployee or any business relationship whatsoever, other than banking services, between the Bank \\\\nand any relative of an NBE employee up to the second degree shall be reported to the relevant \\\\nGroup Head and the Compliance Officer at the Head Office.\\\\nBorrowings and advances\\\\nNo amounts of money (i.e. personal advances) may be lent or borrowed by any NBE employee \\\\nfrom other employees, third parties (such as existing customers or suppliers) or any other NBE-\\\\nrelated third parties.\\\\nBorrowing shall be made from financial institutions.\\\\nTransactions of benefit to any NBE employee or any of his/her relatives or friends\\\\nNBE’s employees shall not be involved in any collateral, evaluation or approval processes in respect \\\\nof any loans or similar transactions between NBE and their relatives, in-laws or friends.\\\\nBanking transactions\\\\nEmployees are prohibited from processing orders/transactions on their personal accounts or the \\\\naccounts of their relatives up to the third degree (i.e. processing the application/transaction, not \\\\npresenting the application. For example, a teller withdraws money from his/her account through \\\\nthe teller’s till or a transfer officer processes a personal transfer using his/her PIN code).\\\\nStaff accounts\\\\nNBE staff accounts are to be used to credit monthly salaries and process normal personal \\\\ntransactions of employees only. All types of personal accounts shall not be utilized as an \\\\nintermediary account for the transactions of any other party. Such account may not be utilized for \\\\ncollecting amounts of money. No NBE staff account shall be utilized by a third party for banking \\\\ntransactions (receiving deposits or transfers) in favour of other persons.\\\\nLegal powers of attorney \\\\nNBE’s employees may not issue/accept any legal or personal powers of attorney (PoA) to process \\\\nbanking transactions. The approval of Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group \\\\n--- Page 39 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group38Head must be obtained prior to issuing PoAs (by or for) NBE\\\\'s employees.\\\\nEmployees’ investments (stock markets/securities)\\\\nEmployees are allowed to trade securities in public subscriptions and carry out buy and sell \\\\ntransactions pursuant to the following controls:\\\\nProhibited use of insider information:\\\\n. 1Employees may not, by virtue of their positions or the nature of their duties, use insider \\\\ninformation for their own benefit or for the benefit of others, or disclose such information to a \\\\nthird party, directly or indirectly.\\\\n. 2No employee may trade a security if s/he (trader) has a direct or indirect access to relevant \\\\nmaterial information and knows that such information exists but not announced. Employees \\\\nmay not disclose such information to any other party unless it has an established legal capacity \\\\nthat authorizes such access.\\\\n. 3It is prohibited to disclose material insider information to any person (Tipping Off), including \\\\nfamily members who may in turn buy or sell securities, or transfer such information to another \\\\nperson who may buy or sell securities.\\\\n. 4Employees may trade on the stock exchange, subject to notifying the Regulatory Compliance \\\\nand Corporate Governance Group and   undertaking to present the relevant statements of \\\\naccount from Misr for Clearing, Settlement and Depository (MCSD) with respect to such \\\\ntrades upon the Bank’s request.\\\\n. 5Employees shall comply with the relevant laws and regulatory controls.\\\\nEngagement in outside employment\\\\nEmployees are prohibited from working for other entities, acting as directors in any companies/\\\\nassociations or partners in any business, engaging in consultancy business or self-employment \\\\nincluding part-time job (whether paid or not), unless a prior written consent is obtained from the \\\\nrelevant Region/Group Head and the Regulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group \\\\nas well as the consent of the Chairman or his substitute. \\\\nMoreover, it is prohibited to engage in fraudulent marketing activities (i.e.a fraudulent investment \\\\nscheme to persuade some individuals to contribute a certain sum of money to raise funds, \\\\npromising them to receive a commission/return if they can persuade others to participate, which 5\\\\n5-  Insider information: any material information that is not announced to public traders and related to the business of a \\\\ncompany whose securities are traded, or any of its related parties or entities.\\\\nMaterial information: information that has a tangible impact on the price of the offered or tradable security, the investment \\\\ndecisions of traders, or trading trends in the market.\\\\n--- Page 40 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group39ends in failure when new people stop to join).\\\\nUsing or exploiting the Bank\\\\'s name or logo in personal matters \\\\nIt is prohibited to print any papers, documents or publicity material (e.g. agendas, calendars, pens, \\\\nflash memories, etc.) or purchase notebooks or prints bearing the Bank\\\\'s logo from any third \\\\nparty, which shall be carried out only through the relevant division at the Bank.\\\\nIt is also prohibited to use the Bank\\\\'s logo for any reason outside the scope of business without \\\\nreferring to the relevant divisions.\\\\nDealing on arm’s length basis with all parties\\\\nAll NBE’s employees shall observe the principles of fairness and objectivity in dealing with all \\\\ninternal parties (colleagues, superiors and subordinates) and external parties (customers, suppliers \\\\nand competitors). \\\\nAccordingly, NBE’s employees should not unfairly receive any personal gain or privileges from such \\\\nparties through manipulation, concealment, deceit or improper use of information and data to \\\\nwhich they have access due to the nature of their work at NBE.\\\\nConflict of Interest Policy and Directors\\\\nDirectors shall take due diligence to serve the best interest of the Bank, taking into account \\\\ntwo key factors: first, observing the Bank’s interests with honesty and good faith for the utmost \\\\nbenefit of the Bank while exercising due diligence and care; second, remaining loyal to the \\\\ninterests of beneficiaries and depositors by dealing with them on arm’s length basis, monitoring \\\\nthe transactions of affiliated or related parties, being keen on avoiding any conflict of interests, and \\\\nrefraining from taking or participating in any decision in case a potential conflict of interest exists \\\\nwith the director’s duties or responsibilities.\\\\nThe Board approves the policies on managing conflict of interest and oversees their application \\\\nto the Board, executive management, staff and any other party directly/indirectly related to NBE. \\\\nThese policies include, but are not limited to:\\\\n• Directors/senior executives should disclose to the Board any direct/indirect financial interest \\\\nfor their benefit/on behalf of third parties in relation to any transactions/matters having direct \\\\nimpact on the Bank.\\\\n• A director, in his/her personal capacity or as a representative of third parties, may neither act \\\\nas a director nor engage in management or consultancy roles in another bank or credit firm.\\\\n• The Bank may not offer finance, advances, credit facilities or guarantees of any kind to its \\\\nchairman, directors, auditors, or their spouses or second-degree relatives;

NBE\\\\'S SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ROLE \\\\n• NBE supports Egypt\\\\'s future vision which is in agreement with the global sustainable \\\\ndevelopment goals (SDGs) under which man attains development with an eye to achieving \\\\neconomic and social development and welfare of Egyptians in all aspects of their daily life. T o \\\\nthis end, the Bank has developed a growing interest to participate in meeting the healthcare, \\\\neducational and economic needs of Egyptians as well as achieving slums development. NBE \\\\nplays this vital role in order to produce a positive impact on the Egyptian society. The Bank \\\\nexerts incessant efforts to directly reach out to targeted beneficiaries to make a remarkable \\\\ndifference in the life of Egyptians. This is demonstrated by the large number of social \\\\n--- Page 42 ---\\\\nRegulatory Compliance and Corporate Governance Group41responsibility projects undertaken by NBE. Being the oldest Egyptian bank with the greatest \\\\ncontributions to the national economy, NBE in fact deserves to be \\\"The People\\\\'s Bank\\\". NBE \\\\ntook the lead as one of the first banking and economic institutions to r ealize the significance of \\\\nits role in serving the community.\\\\n• Over the previous years, NBE\\\\'s contributions were mainly directed to healthcare, education, \\\\nand combating poverty. In addition, NBE made significant contributions to support disabled \\\\npeople and to promote culture, protect our heritage and support breadwinning women.\\\\n14.

These principles define rules and procedures that achieve the optimum \\\\nprotection and balance between the interests of directors, shareholders and \\\\nstakeholders.  \\\\n \\\\nThese rules should be seen to complement companies\\\\' articles of incorporation, \\\\nespecially joint stock companies , limited and general partnerships with shares  and \\\\nlimited liability companies  incorporated under Law 159 /1984, Capital Market Law \\\\n95/1992 and relevant executive regulations and decrees.  \\\\n \\\\nThese principles are unique and separate from legal stipulations. They extend \\\\nbeyond legal provisos. They form guidelines  for the correctly and proper conduct of \\\\ncorporate management, according to international practice and standards that \\\\nachieve an equitable arrangement of stakeholders\\\\' interests. These principles are \\\\nstraightforward. They are guidelines, explained thoroughly, without resorting to \\\\njargon, legalese or abstract rules. \\\\n \\\\nThough they do not carry the weight of legal enforcement as such, their pertinence is \\\\nmuch greater. Egyptian companies and shareholders who strive to implement and \\\\nabide by these principles are doing so for the sake of their companies and the overall \\\\ninvestment climate. They are embracing the spirit of the era: openness and \\\\ntransparency. Moreover, auditors and legal consultants are encouraged to take up \\\\nthe significant role of urging directors to abide by these principles and monitor their \\\\nimplementation. Banks, financial institutions and credit rating agencies should \\\\nconsider companies\\\\' compliance with these principles during evaluation.  \\\\n \\\\nWe hope directors of companies, financial institutions, professional committees and \\\\nshareholders will introduce and promote these principles, using them as a yardstick \\\\nto measure their achievement.  \\\\n \\\\n 4\\\\n--- Page 5 ---\\\\n1 Scope of Implementation \\\\n \\\\n1.1 These rules are primarily applicable to joint stock companies listed on the \\\\nstock market, especially those being actively traded. Also they apply to financial \\\\ninstitutions with a joint stock company st ructure. Many partners own this type of \\\\ncompany. The relationship between owners and directors should be clearly stated. \\\\nThey are also applicable to companies that directly impact the public. Included in this \\\\ncategory are companies mainly financed by banks as compliance with corporate \\\\ngovernance ensures creditors\\\\' rights.  \\\\n \\\\nCorporate governance principles are dev eloped to accommodate companies formed \\\\nunder Law 159/1984 covering joint stock companies, partnerships formed through \\\\nthe allocation of shares and limited liabilities companies, companies operating under \\\\nCapital Market Law 95/1992 and the CASE rules governing the listing and cancelling \\\\nof securities.  Therefore, whenever the words \\\"company\\\" or \\\"companies\\\" are \\\\nmentioned in these principles, they refer to CASE listed companies as well as \\\\nfinancial institutions adopting a  joint stock company form, even if not listed on CASE. \\\\nThe latter group includes banks, insurance, mortgage finance and securitization \\\\ncompanies as well as companies funded by banks. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.2 Corporate governance principles are vital for all companies. Other companies \\\\nmay be considered in the initial stages before being listing or offered for public \\\\nsubscription. Corporate governance principles briefly include items applicable to \\\\nclosed joint stock companies, limited liability companies and individuals\\\\' companies. \\\\nWhile this may contradict principles in other countries, Egypt is justified to do this as \\\\nonly 2.5% of Egyptian companies are listed on CASE.  \\\\n \\\\n1.3 Developments in the Egyptian economy and the stock market, especially in \\\\nrecent years, indicate that many clos ed joint stock companies will be listed on CASE \\\\nin the future. Thus, it is important that companies\\\\' shareholders and directors pay \\\\nattention to corporate governance principles, in preparation for listing on the stock \\\\nmarket. Proper qualification for public offering or listing is a main goal of corporate \\\\ngovernance. Therefore, shareholders, creditors and staff will benefit from \\\\nencouraging and monitoring companies\\\\' compliance with these principles as much as \\\\npossible even if they are not listed.   \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.4 Applied properly, corporate governance do not merely mean respecting and \\\\nliterally interpreting a set of rules. It is a culture and practice governing the \\\\nrelationship between company owners, directors and stakeholders. The wider the \\\\nscope of implementation, the greater the benefits for society as a whole.  \\\\n 5\\\\n--- Page 6 ---\\\\n2- General Assembly  (or General Meeting) \\\\n \\\\n2-1 The General Assembly (GA) comprises shareholders, each according to his \\\\nshare. While a company\\\\'s bylaws may stipulate that GAs are attended only by \\\\npartners holding shares, this provision should be considered an exception to the \\\\ngeneral rule entitling shareholders to attend GAs. It is effective only when the number \\\\nof shareholders cannot be accommodated. However, it should not be a way to ignore \\\\nor exclude small shareholders.   \\\\n \\\\n2-2 Shareholders should be encouraged to attend GAs. The date and place of \\\\nmeetings should be publicized.  \\\\n \\\\n2-3 Agenda items should be explained clearly to help shareholders make \\\\ndecisions. Information should be provided to help shareholders to make sound \\\\ndecisions and not as a formality.  \\\\n \\\\n2-4 General Assemblies should be managed in a manner that allows \\\\nshareholders to express their opinions . The management should fully and clearly \\\\ndisclose all items on the agenda.  \\\\n \\\\n2-5 Voting on general asse mbly motions should be recorded accurately.  Where \\\\nmotions are contested, a ll votes in fa vour of the motion and all those ag ainst shou ld \\\\nbe counted and recorde d. Then the decision s should be sub mitted to the appropriate  \\\\nadministrative or legisla tive bodies. The rules fo r general assemblies sh ould be \\\\nobserved at all times.   \\\\n 6\\\\n--- Page 7 ---\\\\n3- Board of Directors \\\\n \\\\n3-1 The general assembly appoints the joint stock company\\\\'s board of directors \\\\nto manage the company. Board members are absolutely responsible regardless of \\\\nwhether they form committees or authorize other parties or individuals to undertake \\\\nassignments.  \\\\n \\\\n3-2 The board comprises representatives selected from different groups of \\\\nshareholders. Once appointed, a board member the director is considered a \\\\nshareholders’ representative and should commit to work in the best interests of the \\\\ncompany, and not just for the group he/she represents or those who voted for \\\\nhim/her. \\\\n \\\\n3-3  Egyptian laws stipulate that the board is elected to represent shareholders \\\\nand that it should be proportionally representative according to capital distribution. \\\\nNevertheless, voting rules entitle the majority group in the general assembly to \\\\nappoint all members by voting for each nominee individually. Therefore, proper \\\\ncorporate governance imposes a cumulative method of voting when electing the \\\\nboard. Capital distribution should be considered so that the final result is proportional. \\\\nEach nominee should present his CV to shareholders.  \\\\n \\\\n3-4  The board should comprise a majority of non-executive directors with the \\\\ntechnical or analytical skills to benefit the board and the company. All of the non- \\\\nexecutive directors should dedicate the time and attention necessary to fulfil their \\\\nobligations to the company and not to accept assignments that could be seen to be a \\\\nconflict of interest.  \\\\n \\\\n3-5  New board members should have access to information, data and full \\\\nexplanations. This provides a full picture of  the company\\\\'s activities, administrative \\\\nstructure, budget, strengths and weaknesses – helping them to perform efficiently.  \\\\n \\\\n3-6  The board appoints the chairman and the chief executive officer. Preferably \\\\none person should not combine both positions. If deemed necessary, reasons should \\\\nbe stated in the annual report. In this case the deputy chairman should be non-\\\\nexecutive.  \\\\n \\\\n3-7 The board should supervise the company closely. It should not delegate this \\\\ntask to others.  \\\\n \\\\n3-8 The board should set out rules, regulations and procedures ensuring the \\\\ncompany\\\\'s compliance with existing laws and regulations, rules and \\\\ninformation disclosure to shareholders, creditors and stakeholders. \\\\nCompliance with laws and information disclosure should be objective at all \\\\ntimes.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 7\\\\n--- Page 8 ---\\\\n3-9 The Board’s a uthorization and that of others should be prompt and clear.  \\\\nThe deadline for submitting results to the board should be specified. The board \\\\nshould not issue general or tardy authorizations as they diminish the board’s \\\\nauthority.  \\\\n \\\\n3-10 Company\\\\'s information and data should be available to members whenever \\\\nand however required.  \\\\n \\\\n3-11  Board members may seek external advice and the company should expect to \\\\nremunerate its advisors.. Majority approval in compliance with relevant regulations \\\\nshould precede commissioning advice. \\\\n  \\\\n3-12 The company should remunerate the execut ive directors to attract the best \\\\ncalibres in the market. A committee, with a majority of non-executives may be formed \\\\nfor this purpose. The committee is entitled to propose executives\\\\' remuneration and \\\\nnegotiate with them in consultation with the chief executive officer. The final decision \\\\nshould be left to non-executive members. The names of the committee members \\\\nshould be announced in the annual report. The GA chairman should attend the \\\\nannual meeting to answer shareholders\\\\' questions in this regard. \\\\n \\\\n3-13 Executive members\\\\' payments, incl uding salaries, allowances, in-kind \\\\nbenefits, incentive shares and other financial items should be disclosed.  \\\\nPerformance-related payments should form the largest portion to motivate members’ \\\\nimprovement.   \\\\n \\\\n3-14 Incentive shares should be not given to motivate members to make sound \\\\ndecisions at the short-term only. They should be related to medium and long-term \\\\nimprovements.  \\\\n \\\\n3-15 The terms of e xecutive members\\\\' contracts should not exceed three years, \\\\nunless there are specific circumstances, which should be announced at the GA \\\\nmeeting.  \\\\n \\\\n3-16 The committee references in 3-12 should propose non-executives\\\\' payments. \\\\nto the GA. Discrepancies in payments should be avoided if possible and if not, they \\\\nshould be based on defined tasks or activities.   \\\\n \\\\n17-3 The board should meet at least once every 3 months. The number of \\\\nmeetings and names of absentees should be announced in the annual report.  \\\\nMeetings should be scheduled for members’ convenience.  An agenda should be \\\\ncirculated before the meeting. An exception is special meetings for urgent business. \\\\nIn such cases, executives or director s who are capable of explaining the topic \\\\nthoroughly and responding to questions should attend. Resolutions should not be \\\\npassed except when an ordinary meeting is not possible. In this case voting should \\\\nbe confined to urgent resolutions. Resolutions should be passed unanimously.  \\\\n \\\\n18-3 Non executive members may meet directors for consultation. These meeting \\\\nmay or may not be attended by executive members who should be informed about \\\\nthe time and agenda.  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 8\\\\n--- Page 9 ---\\\\n19-3 The board should review internal regulations and procedures for their \\\\nappropriateness and efficiency regularly. The board is entitled to access of all \\\\ninformation, financial and non-financial reports.   \\\\n \\\\n20-3 The board may form committees to undertake certain tasks for specified \\\\nperiods. Such committees are considered complementary to the board and not a \\\\nmeans to discharge the board from its responsibilities or transfer responsibility to \\\\nanother party.  \\\\n \\\\n21-3 Formation of the board-affiliated committees follows general procedures set \\\\nby the board including its mandate, duration and authority. The supervision of these \\\\ncommittees should be included in procedures. Committees should inform the board \\\\nopenly about their tasks, outcomes and decisions. The board supervises the \\\\ncommittees\\\\' activities periodically to ensure adherence and functionality.   \\\\n \\\\n22-3 An internal audit committee formed from  a number of non-executive members \\\\nshould be assigned to check internal controls and the company\\\\'s working practices.   \\\\n \\\\n23-3 Non-executive members, preferably, are included in committees appointed by \\\\nthe board. Such committees are chaired by non-executive members. Committees \\\\nmay seek the assistance of external advisors at the company\\\\'s expense. The annual \\\\nreport should include a brief summary covering the form of each committee, number \\\\nof meetings, assignments and achievement s. GA meetings should be attended by \\\\ncommittee chairmen.  \\\\n \\\\n24-3 The board appoints a secretary to manage files, minutes and reports. Unless \\\\nasked to leave the meeting, the secretary attends the GA meetings. Members may \\\\ncontact the secretary between meetings. The secretary\\\\'s role extends beyond the \\\\ntraditional functions, proscribed in Egyptian law, such as attending meetings and \\\\npreparing minutes.

Nevertheless, corporate governance \\\\nmay be implemented in all companies, achieving a balance of interests and a new \\\\nmanagement culture. Therefore, the greater  the number of companies abiding by \\\\nthese principles, the higher is the probability of promoting the interests of society, \\\\nshareholders and stakeholders. \\\\n \\\\nSpecifically, closed or family-held jo int stock companies and limited liability \\\\ncompanies should adhere to these rules as closely as is possible.  \\\\n \\\\nIndividuals\\\\' companies should avoid conflict of interests and impose rules of internal \\\\ncontrol. The independence of legal and financial advisors and should be ensured.  \\\\nSocial policies should be disclosed.  \\\\n \\\\nIf corporate governance is not applicable to  closed or family-held joint stock \\\\ncompanies and limited li ability companies, they should have other less- costly \\\\nalternatives that suit their financial and administrative capacit y, while achieving the \\\\nsame results.  \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 15\\\\n    content_length: 22737\\\\n    word_count: 3337\\\\n    processing_timestamp: 2025-07-20T05:41:17.003704\\\\n    status: success\\\\n\\\\n  -     filename: oih-board-summary-eng.pdf\\\\n    filepath: C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\amros\\\\\\\\Downloads\\\\\\\\iVolution\\\\\\\\data\\\\\\\\oih-board-summary-eng.pdf\\\\n    file_extension: .pdf\\\\n    mime_type: application/pdf\\\\n    metadata:       size_bytes: 114602\\\\n      created_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:25.887207\\\\n      modified_time: 2025-07-16T20:52:26.451197\\\\n      file_hash: df7f4bf1c20b45d6ede3139501c9f044c0585af85122108ccc9d561bdaded7d2\\\\n\\\\n    content: --- Page 1 ---\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nOrascom Investment Holding S.A.E.  \\\\nEstablished pursuant to the provisions of Law 95/1992  \\\\nHead Office: Nile City Towers, South Tower,  \\\\n2005 A corniche El Nile, Ramlet Beaulac, 11221, Cairo, Egypt  \\\\nCommercial register number: 394061 Cairo  \\\\n \\\\nSummary of Board of Directors Resolutions by Circulation  \\\\n10 June  2024  \\\\nOn June 10,  2024 , upon the invitation of the Chairman, Eng.
